Appendix/NN A/NN

From/IN the/DT New-Orleans/NNP Times-Democrat/NNP ,/, of/IN March/NNP 29/CD
,/, 1882/CD ./.

Voyage/NN of/IN the/DT Times-Democrat/NNP 's/POS relief/NN boat/NN
through/IN the/DT inundated/JJ regions/NNS ./.

It/PRP was/VBD nine/CD o'clock/RB Thursday/NNP morning/NN when/WRB the/DT
``/`` Susie/NNP ''/'' left/VBD the/DT Mississippi/NNP and/CC entered/VBD
Old/NNP River/NNP ,/, or/CC what/WP is/VBZ now/RB called/VBN the/DT mouth/NN
of/IN the/DT Red/NNP ./. Ascending/VBG on/IN the/DT left/JJ ,/, a/DT
flood/NN was/VBD pouring/VBG in/IN through/IN and/CC over/IN the/DT
levees/NNS on/IN the/DT Chandler/NNP plantation/NN ,/, the/DT most/RBS
northern/JJ point/NN in/IN Pointe/NNP Coup&eacute;e/NNP parish/NN ./. The/DT
water/NN completely/RB covered/VBD the/DT place/NN ,/, although/IN the/DT
levees/NNS had/VBD given/VBN way/NN but/RB a/DT short/JJ time/NN before/RB
./. The/DT stock/NN had/VBD been/VBN gathered/VBN in/IN a/DT large/JJ
flat-boat/NN ,/, where/WRB ,/, without/IN food/NN ,/, as/IN we/PRP
passed/VBD ,/, the/DT animals/NNS were/VBD huddled/VBN together/RB ,/,
waiting/VBG for/IN a/DT boat/NN to/TO tow/VB them/PRP off/RP ./. On/IN
the/DT right-hand/JJ side/NN of/IN the/DT river/NN is/VBZ Turnbull/NNP
's/POS Island/NNP ,/, and/CC on/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT large/JJ plantation/NN
which/WDT formerly/RB was/VBD pronounced/VBN one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS
fertile/JJ in/IN the/DT State/NN ./. The/DT water/NN has/VBZ hitherto/RB
allowed/VBN it/PRP to/TO go/VB scot-free/JJ in/IN usual/JJ floods/NNS ,/,
but/CC now/RB broad/JJ sheets/NNS of/IN water/NN told/VBD only/RB where/WRB
fields/NNS were/VBD ./. The/DT top/NN of/IN the/DT protecting/JJ levee/NN
could/MD be/VB seen/VBN here/RB and/CC there/RB ,/, but/CC nearly/RB all/DT
of/IN it/PRP was/VBD submerged/VBN ./.

The/DT trees/NNS have/VBP put/VBN on/RP a/DT greener/JJR foliage/NN
since/IN the/DT water/NN has/VBZ poured/VBN in/RP ,/, and/CC the/DT
woods/NNS look/VBP bright/JJ and/CC fresh/JJ ,/, but/CC this/DT pleasant/JJ
aspect/NN to/TO the/DT eye/NN is/VBZ neutralized/VBN by/IN the/DT
interminable/JJ waste/NN of/IN water/NN ./. We/PRP pass/VBP mile/NN after/IN
mile/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ nothing/NN but/CC trees/NNS standing/VBG
up/IN to/TO their/PRP$ branches/NNS in/IN water/NN ./. A/DT water-turkey/NN
now/RB and/CC again/RB rises/VBZ and/CC flies/VBZ ahead/RB into/IN the/DT
long/JJ avenue/NN of/IN silence/NN ./. A/DT pirogue/NN sometimes/RB
flits/VBZ from/IN the/DT bushes/NNS and/CC crosses/VBZ the/DT Red/NNP
River/NNP on/IN its/PRP$ way/NN out/IN to/TO the/DT Mississippi/NNP ,/, but/CC
the/DT sad-faced/JJ paddlers/NNS never/RB turn/VBP their/PRP$ heads/NNS
to/TO look/VB at/IN our/PRP$ boat/NN ./. The/DT puffing/NN of/IN the/DT
boat/NN is/VBZ music/NN in/IN this/DT gloom/NN ,/, which/WDT affects/VBZ
one/PRP most/RBS curiously/RB ./. It/PRP is/VBZ not/RB the/DT gloom/NN of/IN
deep/JJ forests/NNS or/CC dark/JJ caverns/NNS ,/, but/CC a/DT peculiar/JJ
kind/NN of/IN solemn/JJ silence/NN and/CC impressive/JJ awe/NN that/WDT
holds/VBZ one/PRP perforce/RB to/TO its/PRP$ recognition/NN ./. We/PRP
passed/VBD two/CD negro/JJ families/NNS on/IN a/DT raft/NN tied/VBN up/RP
in/IN the/DT willows/NNS this/DT morning/NN ./. They/PRP were/VBD
evidently/RB of/IN the/DT well-to-do/JJ class/NN ,/, as/IN they/PRP had/VBD
a/DT supply/NN of/IN meal/NN and/CC three/CD or/CC four/CD hogs/NNS with/IN
them/PRP ./. Their/PRP$ rafts/NNS were/VBD about/RB twenty/CD feet/NNS
square/JJ ,/, and/CC in/IN front/NN of/IN an/DT improvised/JJ shelter/NN
earth/NN had/VBD been/VBN placed/VBN ,/, on/IN which/WDT they/PRP built/VBD
their/PRP$ fire/NN ./.

The/DT current/NN running/VBG down/IN the/DT Atchafalaya/NNP was/VBD very/RB
swift/JJ ,/, the/DT Mississippi/NNP showing/VBG a/DT predilection/NN in/IN
that/DT direction/NN ,/, which/WDT needs/VBZ only/RB to/TO be/VB seen/VBN
to/TO enforce/VB the/DT opinion/NN of/IN that/DT river/NN 's/POS
desperate/JJ endeavors/NNS to/TO find/VB a/DT short/JJ way/NN to/TO the/DT
Gulf/NNP ./. Small/JJ boats/NNS ,/, skiffs/NNS ,/, pirogues/NNS ,/, etc./FW
,/, are/VBP in/IN great/JJ demand/NN ,/, and/CC many/JJ have/VBP been/VBN
stolen/VBN by/IN piratical/JJ negroes/NNPS ,/, who/WP take/VBP them/PRP
where/WRB they/PRP will/MD bring/VB the/DT greatest/JJS price/NN ./. From/IN
what/WP was/VBD told/VBD me/PRP by/IN Mr./NNP C./NNP P./NNP Ferguson/NNP ,/,
a/DT planter/NN near/IN Red/NNP River/NNP Landing/NNP ,/, whose/WP$ place/NN
has/VBZ just/RB gone/VBN under/RP ,/, there/EX is/VBZ much/JJ suffering/NN
in/IN the/DT rear/NN of/IN that/DT place/NN ./. The/DT negroes/NNPS had/VBD
given/VBN up/RP all/DT thoughts/NNS of/IN a/DT crevasse/NN there/RB ,/,
as/IN the/DT upper/JJ levee/NN had/VBD stood/VBD so/RB long/RB ,/, and/CC
when/WRB it/PRP did/VBD come/VB they/PRP were/VBD at/IN its/PRP$ mercy/NN ./.
On/IN Thursday/NNP a/DT number/NN were/VBD taken/VBN out/IN of/IN trees/NNS
and/CC off/IN of/IN cabin/NN roofs/NNS and/CC brought/RP in/RP ,/, many/JJ
yet/RB remaining/VBG ./.

One/PRP does/VBZ not/RB appreciate/VB the/DT sight/NN of/IN earth/NN
until/IN he/PRP has/VBZ travelled/JJ through/IN a/DT flood/NN ./. At/IN
sea/NN one/CD does/VBZ not/RB expect/VB or/CC look/VB for/IN it/PRP ,/,
but/CC here/RB ,/, with/IN fluttering/VBG leaves/NNS ,/, shadowy/JJ
forest/NN aisles/NNS ,/, house-tops/NNS barely/RB visible/JJ ,/, it/PRP
is/VBZ expected/VBN ./. In/IN fact/NN a/DT grave-yard/NN ,/, if/IN the/DT
mounds/NNS were/VBD above/IN water/NN ,/, would/MD be/VB appreciated/VBN
./. The/DT river/NN here/RB is/VBZ known/VBN only/RB because/IN there/EX
is/VBZ an/DT opening/NN in/IN the/DT trees/NNS ,/, and/CC that/DT is/VBZ
all/DT ./. It/PRP is/VBZ in/IN width/NN ,/, from/IN Fort/NNP Adams/NNP on/IN
the/DT left/JJ bank/NN of/IN the/DT Mississippi/NNP to/TO the/DT bank/NN
of/IN Rapides/NNP Parish/NNP ,/, a/DT distance/NN of/IN about/RB sixty/CD
miles/NNS ./. A/DT large/JJ portion/NN of/IN this/DT was/VBD under/IN
cultivation/NN ,/, particularly/RB along/IN the/DT Mississippi/NNP and/CC
back/RB of/IN the/DT Red/NNP ./. When/WRB Red/NNP River/NNP proper/JJ was/VBD
entered/VBN ,/, a/DT strong/JJ current/NN was/VBD running/VBG directly/RB
across/IN it/PRP ,/, pursuing/VBG the/DT same/JJ direction/NN as/IN that/DT
of/IN the/DT Mississippi/NNP ./.

After/IN a/DT run/NN of/IN some/DT hours/NNS ,/, Black/NNP River/NNP was/VBD
reached/VBN ./. Hardly/RB was/VBD it/PRP entered/VBD before/IN signs/NNS
of/IN suffering/NN became/VBD visible/JJ ./. All/PDT the/DT willows/NNS
along/IN the/DT banks/NNS were/VBD stripped/VBN of/IN their/PRP$ leaves/NNS
./. One/CD man/NN ,/, whom/WP your/PRP$ correspondent/NN spoke/VBD to/TO ,/,
said/VBD that/IN he/PRP had/VBD had/VBN one/CD hundred/CD and/CC fifty/CD
head/NN of/IN cattle/NNS and/CC one/CD hundred/CD head/NN of/IN hogs/NNS
./. At/IN the/DT first/JJ appearance/NN of/IN water/NN he/PRP had/VBD
started/VBN to/TO drive/VB them/PRP to/TO the/DT high/JJ lands/NNS of/IN
Avoyelles/NNP ,/, thirty-five/CD miles/NNS off/RB ,/, but/CC he/PRP lost/VBD
fifty/CD head/NN of/IN the/DT beef/NN cattle/NNS and/CC sixty/CD hogs/NNS
./. Black/NNP River/NNP is/VBZ quite/RB picturesque/JJ ,/, even/RB if/IN
its/PRP$ shores/NNS are/VBP under/IN water/NN ./. A/DT dense/JJ growth/NN
of/IN ash/NN ,/, oak/NN ,/, gum/NN ,/, and/CC hickory/NN make/VBP the/DT
shores/NNS almost/RB impenetrable/JJ ,/, and/CC where/WRB one/PRP can/MD
get/VB a/DT view/NN down/IN some/DT avenue/NN in/IN the/DT trees/NNS ,/,
only/RB the/DT dim/JJ outlines/NNS of/IN distant/JJ trunks/NNS can/MD be/VB
barely/RB distinguished/VBN in/IN the/DT gloom/NN ./.

A/DT few/JJ miles/NNS up/IN this/DT river/NN ,/, the/DT depth/NN of/IN
water/NN on/IN the/DT banks/NNS was/VBD fully/RB eight/CD feet/NNS ,/,
and/CC on/IN all/DT sides/NNS could/MD be/VB seen/VBN ,/, still/RB
holding/VBG against/IN the/DT strong/JJ current/NN ,/, the/DT tops/NNS
of/IN cabins/NNS ./. Here/RB and/CC there/RB one/CD overturned/VBN was/VBD
surrounded/VBN by/IN drift-wood/NN ,/, forming/VBG the/DT nucleus/NN of/IN
possibly/RB some/DT future/JJ island/NN ./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO save/VB coal/NN ,/, as/IN it/PRP was/VBD impossible/JJ
to/TO get/VB that/DT fuel/NN at/IN any/DT point/NN to/TO be/VB touched/VBN
during/IN the/DT expedition/NN ,/, a/DT lookout/NN was/VBD kept/VBN for/IN
a/DT wood-pile/NN ./. On/IN rounding/VBG a/DT point/NN a/DT pirogue/NN ,/,
skilfully/RB paddled/VBN by/IN a/DT youth/NN ,/, shot/VBD out/RB ,/, and/CC
in/IN its/PRP$ bow/NN was/VBD a/DT girl/NN of/IN fifteen/CD ,/, of/IN
fair/JJ face/NN ,/, beautiful/JJ black/JJ eyes/NNS ,/, and/CC demure/JJ
manners/NNS ./. The/DT boy/NN asked/VBD for/IN a/DT paper/NN ,/, which/WDT
was/VBD thrown/VBN to/TO him/PRP ,/, and/CC the/DT couple/NN pushed/VBD
their/PRP$ tiny/JJ craft/NN out/IN into/IN the/DT swell/NN of/IN the/DT
boat/NN ./.

Presently/RB a/DT little/JJ girl/NN ,/, not/RB certainly/RB over/IN
twelve/CD years/NNS ,/, paddled/VBD out/RB in/IN the/DT smallest/JJS
little/JJ canoe/NN and/CC handled/VBD it/PRP with/IN all/PDT the/DT
deftness/NN of/IN an/DT old/JJ voyageur/NN ./. The/DT little/JJ one/NN
looked/VBD more/RBR like/IN an/DT Indian/NNP than/IN a/DT white/JJ child/NN
,/, and/CC laughed/VBD when/WRB asked/VBD if/IN she/PRP were/VBD afraid/JJ
./. She/PRP had/VBD been/VBN raised/VBN in/IN a/DT pirogue/NN and/CC
could/MD go/VB anywhere/RB ./. She/PRP was/VBD bound/VBN|JJ out/RB to/TO
pick/VB willow/NN leaves/NNS for/IN the/DT stock/NN ,/, and/CC she/PRP
pointed/VBD to/TO a/DT house/NN near/RB by/RB with/IN water/NN three/CD
inches/NNS deep/JJ on/IN the/DT floors/NNS ./. At/IN its/PRP$ back/NN
door/NN was/VBD moored/VBN a/DT raft/NN about/RB thirty/CD feet/NNS
square/JJ ,/, with/IN a/DT sort/NN of/IN fence/NN built/VBN upon/IN it/PRP
,/, and/CC inside/IN of/IN this/DT some/RB sixteen/CD cows/NNS and/CC
twenty/CD hogs/NNS were/VBD standing/VBG ./. The/DT family/NN did/VBD
not/RB complain/VB ,/, except/VB on/IN account/NN of/IN losing/VBG
their/PRP$ stock/NN ,/, and/CC promptly/RB brought/VBD a/DT supply/NN of/IN
wood/NN in/IN a/DT flat/NN ./.

From/IN this/DT point/NN to/TO the/DT Mississippi/NNP River/NNP ,/,
fifteen/CD miles/NNS ,/, there/EX is/VBZ not/RB a/DT spot/NN of/IN earth/NN
above/IN water/NN ,/, and/CC to/TO the/DT westward/NN for/IN thirty-five/CD
miles/NNS there/EX is/VBZ nothing/NN but/IN the/DT river/NN 's/POS flood/NN
./. Black/NNP River/NNP had/VBD risen/VBN during/IN Thursday/NNP ,/, the/DT
23d/CD ,/, 13\/4/CD inches/NNS ,/, and/CC was/VBD going/VBG up/RB at/IN
night/NN still/RB ./. As/IN we/PRP progress/VBP up/IN the/DT river/NN
habitations/NNS become/VBP more/RBR frequent/JJ ,/, but/CC are/VBP yet/RB
still/RB miles/NNS apart/RB ./. Nearly/RB all/DT of/IN them/PRP are/VBP
deserted/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT out-houses/NNS floated/VBD off/RP ./. To/TO
add/VB to/TO the/DT gloom/NN ,/, almost/RB every/DT living/JJ thing/NN
seems/VBZ to/TO have/VB departed/VBN ,/, and/CC not/RB a/DT whistle/NN
of/IN a/DT bird/NN nor/CC the/DT bark/NN of/IN the/DT squirrel/NN can/MD
be/VB heard/VBN in/IN this/DT solitude/NN ./. Sometimes/RB a/DT morose/JJ
gar/NN will/MD throw/VB his/PRP$ tail/NN aloft/RB and/CC disappear/VB in/IN
the/DT river/NN ,/, but/CC beyond/IN this/DT everything/NN is/VBZ quiet/JJ
--/: the/DT quiet/NN of/IN dissolution/NN ./. Down/IN the/DT river/NN
floats/VBZ now/RB a/DT neatly/RB whitewashed/VBN hen-house/NN ,/, then/RB
a/DT cluster/NN of/IN neatly/RB split/VBN fence-rails/NNS ,/, or/CC a/DT
door/NN and/CC a/DT bloated/JJ carcass/NN ,/, solemnly/RB guarded/VBN by/IN
a/DT pair/NN of/IN buzzards/NNS ,/, the/DT only/JJ bird/NN to/TO be/VB
seen/VBN ,/, which/WDT feast/VBP on/IN the/DT carcass/NN as/IN it/PRP
bears/VBZ them/PRP along/RB ./. A/DT picture-frame/NN in/IN which/WDT
there/EX was/VBD a/DT cheap/JJ lithograph/NN of/IN a/DT soldier/NN on/IN
horseback/NN ,/, as/IN it/PRP floated/VBD on/RB told/VBD of/IN some/DT
hearth/NN invaded/VBN by/IN the/DT water/NN and/CC despoiled/VBN of/IN
this/DT ornament/NN ./.

At/IN dark/JJ|NN ,/, as/IN it/PRP was/VBD not/RB prudent/JJ to/TO run/VB ,/,
a/DT place/NN alongside/IN the/DT woods/NNS was/VBD hunted/VBN and/CC to/TO
a/DT tall/JJ gum-tree/NN the/DT boat/NN was/VBD made/VBN fast/JJ for/IN
the/DT night/NN ./.

A/DT pretty/JJ quarter/NN of/IN the/DT moon/NN threw/VBD a/DT pleasant/JJ
light/NN over/IN forest/NN and/CC river/NN ,/, making/VBG a/DT picture/NN
that/WDT would/MD be/VB a/DT delightful/JJ piece/NN of/IN landscape/NN
study/NN ,/, could/MD an/DT artist/NN only/RB hold/VB it/PRP down/RP to/TO
his/PRP$ canvas/NN ./. The/DT motion/NN of/IN the/DT engines/NNS had/VBD
ceased/VBN ,/, the/DT puffing/NN of/IN the/DT escaping/VBG steam/NN was/VBD
stilled/VBN ,/, and/CC the/DT enveloping/JJ silence/NN closed/VBD upon/IN
us/PRP ,/, and/CC such/JJ silence/NN it/PRP was/VBD !/. Usually/RB in/IN a/DT
forest/NN at/IN night/NN one/PRP can/MD hear/VB the/DT piping/NN of/IN
frogs/NNS ,/, the/DT hum/NN of/IN insects/NNS ,/, or/CC the/DT dropping/NN
of/IN limbs/NNS ;/: but/CC here/RB nature/NN was/VBD dumb/JJ ./. The/DT
dark/JJ recesses/NNS ,/, those/DT aisles/NNS into/IN this/DT cathedral/NN
,/, gave/VBD forth/RB no/DT sound/NN ,/, and/CC even/RB the/DT
ripplings/NNS of/IN the/DT current/NN die/VBP away/RP ./.

At/IN daylight/NN Friday/NNP morning/NN all/DT hands/NNS were/VBD up/RB ,/,
and/CC up/IN the/DT Black/NNP we/PRP started/VBD ./. The/DT morning/NN
was/VBD a/DT beautiful/JJ one/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT river/NN ,/, which/WDT
is/VBZ remarkably/RB straight/JJ ,/, put/VBD on/IN its/PRP$ loveliest/JJS
garb/NN ./. The/DT blossoms/NNS of/IN the/DT haw/NN perfumed/VBD the/DT
air/NN deliciously/RB ,/, and/CC a/DT few/JJ birds/NNS whistled/VBD
blithely/RB along/IN the/DT banks/NNS ./. The/DT trees/NNS were/VBD
larger/JJR ,/, and/CC the/DT forest/NN seemed/VBD of/IN older/JJR growth/NN
than/IN below/RB ./. More/JJR fields/NNS were/VBD passed/VBN than/IN
nearer/IN the/DT mouth/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT same/JJ scene/NN presented/VBD
itself/PRP --/: smoke-houses/NNS drifting/VBG out/IN in/IN the/DT
pastures/NNS ,/, negro/JJ quarters/NNS anchored/VBN in/IN confusion/NN
against/IN some/DT oak/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT modest/JJ residence/NN just/RB
showing/VBG its/PRP$ eaves/NNS above/IN water/NN ./. The/DT sun/NN came/VBD
up/RP in/IN a/DT glory/NN of/IN carmine/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT trees/NNS
were/VBD brilliant/JJ in/IN their/PRP$ varied/JJ shades/NNS of/IN green/NN
./. Not/RB a/DT foot/NN of/IN soil/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB seen/VBN
anywhere/RB ,/, and/CC the/DT water/NN is/VBZ apparently/RB growing/VBG
deeper/JJR and/CC deeper/JJR ,/, for/IN it/PRP reaches/VBZ up/IN to/TO
the/DT branches/NNS of/IN the/DT largest/JJS trees/NNS ./. All/RB along/RB
,/, the/DT bordering/VBG willows/NNS have/VBP been/VBN denuded/VBN of/IN
leaves/NNS ,/, showing/VBG how/WRB long/RB the/DT people/NNS have/VBP
been/VBN at/IN work/NN gathering/VBG this/DT fodder/NN for/IN their/PRP$
animals/NNS ./. An/DT old/JJ man/NN in/IN a/DT pirogue/NN was/VBD asked/VBN
how/WRB the/DT willow/NN leaves/NNS agreed/VBD with/IN his/PRP$ cattle/NNS
./. He/PRP stopped/VBD in/IN his/PRP$ work/NN ,/, and/CC with/IN an/DT
ominous/JJ shake/NN of/IN his/PRP$ head/NN replied/VBD :/: ``/`` Well/UH ,/,
sir/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ enough/JJ to/TO keep/VB warmth/NN in/IN their/PRP$

's/VBZ hard/JJ on/IN the/DT hogs/NNS ,/, particularly/RB the/DT small/JJ

But/CC what/WP can/MD you/PRP do/VB ?/. It/PRP 's/VBZ all/DT we/PRP 've/VBP
got/VBD ./. ''/''

At/IN thirty/CD miles/NNS above/IN the/DT mouth/NN of/IN Black/NNP River/NNP
the/DT water/NN extends/VBZ from/IN Natchez/NNP on/IN the/DT Mississippi/NNP
across/IN to/TO the/DT pine/NN hills/NNS of/IN Louisiana/NNP ,/, a/DT
distance/NN of/IN seventy-three/CD miles/NNS ,/, and/CC there/EX is/VBZ
hardly/RB a/DT spot/NN that/WDT is/VBZ not/RB ten/CD feet/NNS under/IN
it/PRP ./. The/DT tendency/NN of/IN the/DT current/NN up/IN the/DT Black/NNP
is/VBZ toward/IN the/DT west/NN ./. In/IN fact/NN ,/, so/RB much/RB is/VBZ
this/DT the/DT case/NN ,/, the/DT waters/NNS of/IN Red/NNP River/NNP have/VBP
been/VBN driven/VBN down/IN from/IN toward/IN the/DT Calcasieu/NNP
country/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT waters/NNS of/IN the/DT Black/NNP enter/VBP
the/DT Red/NNP some/RB fifteen/CD miles/NNS above/IN the/DT mouth/NN of/IN
the/DT former/NN ,/, a/DT thing/NN never/RB before/IN seen/VBN by/IN
even/RB the/DT oldest/JJS steamboatmen/NNS ./. The/DT water/NN now/RB in/IN
sight/NN of/IN us/PRP is/VBZ entirely/RB from/IN the/DT Mississippi/NNP ./.

Up/IN to/TO Trinity/NNP ,/, or/CC rather/RB Troy/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ
but/RB a/DT short/JJ distance/NN below/RB ,/, the/DT people/NNS have/VBP
nearly/RB all/DT moved/VBD out/RP ,/, those/DT remaining/VBG having/VBG
enough/NN for/IN their/PRP$ present/JJ personal/JJ needs/NNS ./. Their/PRP$
cattle/NNS ,/, though/RB ,/, are/VBP suffering/VBG and/CC dying/VBG off/RP
quite/RB fast/RB ,/, as/IN the/DT confinement/NN on/IN rafts/NNS and/CC
the/DT food/NN they/PRP get/VBP breeds/VBZ disease/NN ./.

After/IN a/DT short/JJ stop/NN we/PRP started/VBD ,/, and/CC soon/RB
came/VBD to/TO a/DT section/NN where/WRB there/EX were/VBD many/JJ open/JJ
fields/NNS and/CC cabins/NNS thickly/RB scattered/VBN about/RB ./. Here/RB
were/VBD seen/VBN more/JJR pictures/NNS of/IN distress/NN ./. On/IN the/DT
inside/NN of/IN the/DT houses/NNS the/DT inmates/NNS had/VBD built/VBN
on/IN boxes/NNS a/DT scaffold/NN on/IN which/WDT they/PRP placed/VBD the/DT
furniture/NN ./. The/DT bed-posts/NNS were/VBD sawed/VBN off/RP on/IN
top/NN ,/, as/IN the/DT ceiling/NN was/VBD not/RB more/JJR than/IN four/CD
feet/NNS from/IN the/DT improvised/JJ floor/NN ./. The/DT buildings/NNS
looked/VBD very/RB insecure/JJ ,/, and/CC threaten/VBP every/DT moment/NN
to/TO float/VB off/RB ./. Near/IN the/DT houses/NNS were/VBD cattle/NNS
standing/VBG breast/NN high/JJ in/IN the/DT water/NN ,/, perfectly/RB
impassive/JJ ./. They/PRP did/VBD not/RB move/NN in/IN their/PRP$ places/NNS
,/, but/CC stood/VBD patiently/RB waiting/VBG for/IN help/NN to/TO come/VB
./. The/DT sight/NN was/VBD a/DT distressing/JJ one/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT
poor/JJ creatures/NNS will/MD be/VB sure/JJ to/TO die/VB unless/IN
speedily/RB rescued/VBN ./. Cattle/NNS differ/VBP from/IN horses/NNS in/IN
this/DT peculiar/JJ quality/NN ./. A/DT horse/NN ,/, after/IN finding/VBG
no/DT relief/NN comes/VBZ ,/, will/MD swim/VB off/RB in/IN search/NN of/IN
food/NN ,/, whereas/IN a/DT beef/NN will/MD stand/VB in/IN its/PRP$

water/NN and/CC drowns/VBZ ./.

At/IN half-past/JJ twelve/CD o'clock/RB a/DT hail/NN was/VBD given/VBN
from/IN a/DT flat-boat/NN inside/IN the/DT line/NN of/IN the/DT bank/NN ./.
Rounding/VBG to/TO we/PRP ran/VBD alongside/RB ,/, and/CC General/NNP York/NNP
stepped/VBD aboard/RB ./. He/PRP was/VBD just/RB then/RB engaged/VBN in/IN
getting/VBG off/RP stock/NN ,/, and/CC welcomed/VBD the/DT ``/``
Times-Democrat/NNP Boat/NNP ''/'' heartily/RB ,/, as/IN he/PRP said/VBD
there/EX was/VBD much/JJ need/VB for/IN her/PRP ./. He/PRP said/VBD that/IN
the/DT distress/NN was/VBD not/RB exaggerated/VBN in/IN the/DT least/JJS

After/IN leaving/VBG the/DT Ellis/NNP place/NN ,/, the/DT next/JJ spot/NN

The/DT condition/NN of/IN this/DT rich/JJ valley/NN of/IN the/DT Lower/NNP

It/PRP might/MD have/VB been/VBN expected/VBN by/IN those/DT who/WP have/VBP

It/PRP has/VBZ needed/VBN but/RB little/JJ attention/NN to/TO make/VB it/PRP

Neither/DT are/VBP the/DT States/NNS especially/RB interested/JJ

the/DT wear/NN of/IN the/DT stream/NN ,/, and/CC much/JJ of/IN the/DT

be/VB generally/RB designated/VBN works/NNS of/IN revetment/NN ;/: and/CC
these/DT also/RB will/MD be/VB largely/RB of/IN brushwood/NN ,/, woven/VBN

with/IN sediments/NNS ,/, and/CC have/VBP become/VBN so/RB overgrown/JJ

Any/DT one/NN who/WP has/VBZ been/VBN on/IN the/DT Rhine/NNP will/MD have/VB

alluvia/NNS have/VBP required/VBN similar/JJ treatment/NN in/IN the/DT
interest/NN of/IN navigation/NN and/CC agriculture/NN ./.

The/DT levee/NN is/VBZ the/DT crowning/JJ work/NN of/IN bank/NN
revetment/NN ,/, although/IN not/RB necessarily/RB in/IN immediate/JJ
connection/NN ./. It/PRP may/MD be/VB set/VBN back/RB a/DT short/JJ
distance/NN from/IN the/DT revetted/JJ bank/NN ;/: but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ ,/,
in/IN effect/NN ,/, the/DT requisite/JJ parapet/NN ./. The/DT flood/NN
river/NN and/CC the/DT low/JJ river/NN can/MD not/RB be/VB brought/VBN
into/IN register/NN ,/, and/CC compelled/VBN to/TO unite/VB in/IN the/DT
excavation/NN of/IN a/DT single/JJ permanent/JJ channel/NN ,/, without/IN
a/DT complete/JJ control/NN of/IN all/PDT the/DT stages/NNS ;/: and/CC
even/RB the/DT abnormal/JJ rise/NN must/MD be/VB provided/VBN against/IN

once/RB in/IN force/NN behind/IN the/DT works/NNS of/IN revetment/NN
would/MD tear/VB them/PRP also/RB away/RP ./.

Under/IN the/DT general/JJ principle/NN that/IN the/DT local/JJ slope/NN
of/IN a/DT river/NN is/VBZ the/DT result/NN and/CC measure/NN of/IN the/DT
resistance/NN of/IN its/PRP$ bed/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ evident/JJ that/IN a/DT
narrow/JJ and/CC deep/JJ stream/NN should/MD have/VB less/JJR slope/NN ,/,
because/IN it/PRP has/VBZ less/JJR frictional/JJ surface/NN in/IN
proportion/NN to/TO capacity/NN ;/: i.e./FW ,/, less/JJR perimeter/NN in/IN
proportion/NN to/TO area/NN of/IN cross/JJ section/NN ./. The/DT
ultimate/JJ effect/NN of/IN levees/NNS and/CC revetments/NNS confining/VBG
the/DT floods/NNS and/CC bringing/VBG all/PDT the/DT stages/NNS of/IN
the/DT river/NN into/IN register/NN is/VBZ to/TO deepen/VB the/DT
channel/NN and/CC let/VB down/RP the/DT slope/NN ./. The/DT first/JJ
effect/NN of/IN the/DT levees/NNS is/VBZ to/TO raise/VB the/DT surface/NN
;/: but/CC this/DT ,/, by/IN inducing/VBG greater/JJR velocity/NN of/IN

,/, and/CC if/IN this/DT enlargement/NN is/VBZ prevented/VBN from/IN
being/VBG made/VBN at/IN the/DT expense/NN of/IN the/DT banks/NNS ,/,
the/DT bottom/NN must/MD give/VB way/NN and/CC the/DT form/NN of/IN the/DT
waterway/NN be/VB so/RB improved/VBN as/IN to/TO admit/VB this/DT flow/NN
with/IN less/JJR rise/NN ./. The/DT actual/JJ experience/NN with/IN
levees/NNS upon/IN the/DT Mississippi/NNP River/NNP ,/, with/IN no/DT

,/, and/CC no/DT one/NN can/MD doubt/VB ,/, upon/IN the/DT evidence/NN

that/IN if/IN the/DT earliest/JJS levees/NNS had/VBD been/VBN

navigable/JJ at/IN low/JJ water/NN and/CC an/DT adjacent/JJ country/NN

Of/IN course/NN it/PRP would/MD be/VB illogical/JJ to/TO conclude/VB that/IN
the/DT constrained/JJ river/NN can/MD ever/RB lower/VB its/PRP$ flood/NN

it/PRP is/VBZ believed/VBN that/IN ,/, by/IN this/DT lateral/JJ

improved/VBN in/IN form/NN that/IN even/RB those/DT rare/JJ floods/NNS
which/WDT result/VBP from/IN the/DT coincident/JJ rising/NN of/IN many/JJ
tributaries/NNS will/MD find/VB vent/NN without/IN destroying/VBG
levees/NNS of/IN ordinary/JJ height/NN ./. That/IN the/DT actual/JJ
capacity/NN of/IN a/DT channel/NN through/IN alluvium/NN depends/VBZ
upon/IN its/PRP$ service/NN during/IN floods/NNS has/VBZ been/VBN often/RB
shown/VBN ,/, but/CC this/DT capacity/NN does/VBZ not/RB include/VB

not/RB well/RB be/VB a/DT more/RBR unphilosophical/JJ method/NN of/IN

In/IN a/DT remote/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT North/NNP lived/VBD a/DT man/NN
