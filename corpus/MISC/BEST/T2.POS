How/WRB Dangerous/JJ are/VBP Pesticides/NNS ?/.

When/WRB a/DT word/NN ends/VBZ with/IN the/DT letters/NNS i-c-i-d-e/NNS ,/,
the/DT word/NN means/VBZ to/TO kill/VB ./.

A/DT pesticide/NN is/VBZ something/NN ,/, usually/RB a/DT chemical/NN ,/,
which/WDT kills/VBZ pests/NNS ./.

Because/IN pesticides/NNS are/VBP formulated/VBN to/TO kill/VB ,/, they/PRP
are/VBP ,/, by/IN their/PRP$ very/JJ nature/NN ,/, toxic/JJ and/CC some/DT
of/IN them/PRP are/VBP hazardous/JJ to/TO people/NNS ./.

The/DT term/NN pesticide/NN is/VBZ a/DT general/JJ category/NN with/IN a/DT
large/JJ number/NN of/IN subcategories/NNS ./.  For/IN example/NN ,/, an/DT
insecticide/NN kills/VBZ insects/NNS ,/, a/DT herbicide/NN kills/VBZ
plants/NNS ,/, a/DT miticide/NN kills/VBZ mites/NNS ,/, and/CC a/DT
rodenticide/NN kills/VBZ rodents/NNS ./.

There/EX are/VBP some/DT other/JJ chemicals/NNS which/WDT control/VBP
pests/NNS and/CC are/VBP classified/VBN as/IN pesticides/NNS but/CC they/PRP
do/VBP n't/RB have/VB the/DT letters/NNS i-c-i-d-e/NNS at/IN the/DT end/NN
of/IN their/PRP$ names/NNS ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, a/DT repellent/NN will/MD keep/VB away/RP pests/NNS
,/, an/DT attractant/NN will/MD lure/VB pests/NNS ,/, a/DT plant/NN
growth/NN regulator/NN stops/VBZ ,/, speeds/VBZ up/RP ,/, or/CC
otherwise/RB changes/VBZ normal/JJ plant/NN processes/NNS ,/, and/CC
desiccants/NNS and/CC defoliants/NNS are/VBP harvest/NN aid/NN
chemicals/NNS used/VBN to/TO remove/VB or/CC kill/VB leaves/NNS and/CC
stems/NNS ./.

Pesticides/NNS can/MD also/RB be/VB grouped/VBN according/VBG to/TO what/WP
they/PRP do/VBP ./.  Many/JJ work/VBP in/IN more/JJR than/IN one/CD way/NN
./.

Read/VB the/DT label/NN to/TO find/VB out/RP what/WP the/DT one/NN you/PRP
plan/VBP to/TO use/VB does/VBZ ./.

Here/RB are/VBP some/DT of/IN the/DT ways/NNS pesticides/NNS work/VBP ./.

Contact/NN pesticides/NNS kill/VBP pests/NNS simply/RB by/IN coming/VBG
in/IN contact/NN with/IN them/PRP ./.

Stomach/NN poisons/NNS kill/VBP by/IN being/VBG swallowed/VBN by/IN the/DT
pest/NN ./.

Systemics/NNS kill/VBP pests/NNS by/IN being/VBG taken/VBN into/IN the/DT
blood/NN of/IN the/DT animal/NN or/CC sap/NN of/IN the/DT plant/NN on/IN
which/WDT the/DT pest/NN is/VBZ feeding/VBG ./.

Translocated/JJ herbicides/NNS are/VBP pesticides/NNS which/WDT kill/VBP
plants/NNS by/IN being/VBG absorbed/VBN by/IN leaves/NNS ,/, stems/NNS ,/,
or/CC roots/NNS and/CC moving/VBG throughout/IN the/DT plant/NN ./.

Fumigants/NNS are/VBP gases/NNS which/WDT kill/VBP when/WRB they/PRP are/VBP
inhaled/VBN or/CC otherwise/RB absorbed/VBN by/IN the/DT pests/NNS ./.

Selective/JJ pesticides/NNS are/VBP those/DT which/WDT kill/VBP certain/JJ
kinds/NNS of/IN plants/NNS or/CC animals/NNS whereas/IN non-selective/JJ
pesticides/NNS are/VBP those/DT which/WDT kill/VBP most/JJS plants/NNS
or/CC animals/NNS ./.

You/PRP can/MD tell/VB how/WRB toxic/JJ a/DT pesticide/NN is/VBZ by/IN
reading/VBG the/DT signal/NN word/NN and/CC symbol/NN on/IN the/DT label/NN
./.

The/DT signal/NN word/NN "/" Danger/NN "/" means/VBZ that/IN the/DT
product/NN is/VBZ highly/RB toxic/JJ ./.

You/PRP will/MD find/VB the/DT skull/NN and/CC crossbones/NNS and/CC the/DT
word/NN "/" Poison/NN "/" on/IN the/DT label/NN of/IN these/DT products/NNS
./.

Rarely/RB are/VBP the/DT pesticides/NNS in/IN this/DT toxicity/NN
category/NN available/JJ for/IN home/NN use/NN ./.

The/DT signal/NN word/NN "/" Warning/NN "/" means/VBZ that/IN the/DT
product/NN is/VBZ moderately/RB toxic/JJ ./.

The/DT signal/NN word/NN "/" Caution/NN "/" means/VBZ that/IN the/DT
pesticide/NN has/VBZ a/DT low/JJ toxicity/NN or/CC is/VBZ comparatively/RB
free/JJ from/IN danger/NN ./.

There/EX is/VBZ a/DT statement/NN of/IN practical/JJ treatment/NN or/CC
first/JJ aid/NN directions/NNS on/IN the/DT label/NN of/IN every/DT
pesticide/NN container/NN ./.

This/DT statement/NN tells/VBZ you/PRP what/WP you/PRP should/MD do/VB if/IN
the/DT pesticide/NN is/VBZ accidentally/RB inhaled/VBN ,/, swallowed/VBN
,/, or/CC brought/VBN in/IN contact/NN with/IN skin/NN ./.

If/IN the/DT product/NN is/VBZ highly/RB toxic/JJ there/EX will/MD be/VB
a/DT note/NN to/TO physicians/NNS on/IN the/DT product/NN label/NN ./.

The/DT pesticide/NN label/NN is/VBZ the/DT most/RBS important/JJ

someone/NN has/VBZ been/VBN poisoned/VBN ./.

The/DT label/NN on/IN the/DT pesticide/NN container/NN is/VBZ the/DT
best/JJS source/NN of/IN information/NN about/IN that/DT particular/JJ

The/DT directions/NNS for/IN use/NN will/MD tell/VB you/PRP (/( 1/LS )/)
the/DT crop/NN ,/, animal/NN or/CC other/JJ item/NN the/DT product/NN

When/WRB using/VBG a/DT pesticide/NN ,/, you/PRP should/MD read/VB the/DT
label/NN carefully/RB before/IN using/VBG it/PRP ./.

Do/VB n't/RB use/VB the/DT pesticide/NN and/CC then/RB read/VB the/DT
label/NN ./.  Clothes/NNS Moths/NNS and/CC Carpet/NN Beetles/NNS Both/DT
clothes/NNS moths/NNS and/CC carpet/NN beetles/NNS infest/VBP fabrics/NNS
made/VBN from/IN animals/NNS or/CC fabrics/NNS which/WDT have/VBP an/DT

However/RB ,/, they/PRP will/MD infest/VB furs/NNS ,/, hides/NNS and/CC

Clothes/NNS moths/NNS and/CC carpet/NN beetles/NNS can/MD not/RB

But/CC ,/, if/IN clothes/NNS made/VBN from/IN cotton/NN or/CC synthetic/JJ
fabrics/NNS have/VBP been/VBN worn/VBN and/CC have/VBP not/RB been/VBN
cleaned/VBN ,/, sometimes/RB the/DT larvae/NNS of/IN these/DT insects/NNS
will/MD chew/VB holes/NNS in/IN the/DT fabric/NN feeding/VBG on/IN the/DT

The/DT most/RBS effective/JJ means/NNS of/IN controlling/VBG clothes/NNS
moths/NNS and/CC carpet/NN beetles/NNS in/IN clothing/NN is/VBZ to/TO
prevent/VB them/PRP from/IN getting/VBG on/IN the/DT clothing/NN in/IN
the/DT first/JJ place/NN ./.

At/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT winter/NN season/NN ,/, clean/VB and/CC
store/VB all/DT woolen/JJ garments/NNS in/IN an/DT insect-proof/JJ

The/DT adults/NNS of/IN both/DT the/DT clothes/NNS moth/NN and/CC the/DT
carpet/NN beetle/NN can/MD not/RB penetrate/VB plastic/NN bags/NNS ,/,
paper/NN bags/NNS ,/, or/CC cardboard/NN boxes/NNS ./.

So/RB ,/, be/VB sure/JJ to/TO use/VB a/DT container/NN made/VBN of/IN
one/CD of/IN these/DT products/NNS and/CC one/NN that/WDT can/MD be/VB
sealed/VBN ./.

Before/IN you/PRP put/VBP your/PRP$ garments/NNS in/IN the/DT insect-proof/JJ
container/NN ,/, add/VB some/DT moth/NN balls/NNS ,/, moth/NN crystals/NNS
or/CC napthylene/NN crystals/NNS ./.

These/DT crystals/NNS do/VBP n't/RB kill/VB the/DT insects/NNS ,/, but/CC
they/PRP do/VBP repel/VB them/PRP and/CC keep/VB them/PRP from/IN entering/VBG
the/DT storage/NN container/NN and/CC laying/VBG the/DT eggs/NNS from/IN
which/WDT the/DT larvae/NNS develop/VBP ./.

After/IN the/DT storage/NN container/NN is/VBZ sealed/VBN with/IN the/DT
napthylene/NN crystals/NNS or/CC moth/NN balls/NNS inside/RB ,/, the/DT
garments/NNS should/MD be/VB safe/JJ from/IN insects/NNS until/IN fall/NN

If/IN you/PRP find/VBP that/IN some/DT of/IN your/PRP$ clothes/NNS already/RB
have/VBP an/DT infestation/NN of/IN clothes/NNS moths/NNS or/CC carpet/NN
beetles/NNS ,/, the/DT garments/NNS should/MD be/VB laundered/VBN or/CC
dry/JJ cleaned/VBN ./.  Putting/VBG the/DT garments/NNS out/RP in/IN the/DT
sun/NN for/IN a/DT day/NN will/MD help/VB drive/VB away/RP some/DT of/IN
the/DT insects/NNS ,/, but/CC this/DT will/MD not/RB kill/VB larvae/NNS
in/IN the/DT clothing/NN and/CC these/DT could/MD still/RB grow/VB to/TO
be/VB adult/NN moths/NNS and/CC beetles/NNS ./.

Also/RB ,/, you/PRP can/MD use/VB a/DT no-pest/JJ strip/NN containing/VBG
the/DT insecticide/NN Vapona/NNP ./.

If/IN you/PRP use/VBP the/DT no-pest/JJ strip/NN ,/, hang/VB it/PRP up/RP

the/DT fumes/NNS from/IN the/DT strip/NN to/TO penetrate/VB all/PDT the/DT

Pantry/NN Pests/NNS Several/JJ kinds/NNS of/IN insects/NNS can/MD infest/VB

Foods/NNS such/JJ as/IN rice/NN ,/, corn/NN ,/, wheat/NN ,/, oats/NNS ,/,

others/NNS ./.

All/DT of/IN these/DT insects/NNS are/VBP controlled/VBN the/DT same/JJ
way/NN ./.  The/DT first/JJ thing/NN you/PRP should/MD do/VB is/VBZ
determine/VB the/DT source/NN of/IN the/DT infestation/NN ./.

If/IN you/PRP have/VBP a/DT lot/NN of/IN beetles/NNS in/IN one/CD cabinet/NN
,/, it/PRP usually/RB means/VBZ that/IN something/NN in/IN that/DT
cabinet/NN is/VBZ heavily/RB infested/VBN ./.

Find/VB the/DT source/NN of/IN the/DT infestation/NN and/CC remove/VB it/PRP
because/IN it/PRP wo/MD n't/RB do/VB any/DT good/NN to/TO use/VB an/DT

source/NN ./.

Once/RB the/DT source/NN of/IN the/DT infestation/NN has/VBZ been/VBN
removed/VBN ,/, the/DT problem/NN will/MD eliminate/VB itself/PRP ./.

Use/VB a/DT vacuum/NN cleaner/NN to/TO clean/VB cabinets/NNS ./.

If/IN you/PRP need/VBP to/TO take/VB further/JJ precautions/NNS ,/, there/EX
are/VBP two/CD non-chemical/JJ methods/NNS of/IN controlling/VBG these/DT
pantry/NN pests/NNS ./.

One/CD method/NN is/VBZ to/TO place/VB the/DT remaining/VBG foods/NNS in/IN
the/DT deep/JJ freeze/NN at/IN zero/CD degrees/NNS Fahrenheit/NNP for/IN
48/CD hours/NNS ./.

The/DT second/JJ method/NN is/VBZ to/TO place/VB the/DT food/NN in/IN
the/DT oven/NN at/IN 140/CD degrees/NNS for/IN approximately/RB 20/CD
minutes/NNS ./.

Either/DT of/IN these/DT methods/NNS will/MD reduce/VB and/CC kill/VB
all/DT stages/NNS of/IN the/DT pantry/NN pests/NNS ./.

Silverfish/NNS and/CC Earwigs/NNS Silverfish/NNS and/CC earwigs/NNS are/VBP
completely/RB unrelated/JJ insects/NNS ;/: however/RB ,/, they/PRP are/VBP
two/CD pests/NNS which/WDT are/VBP frequently/RB found/VBN in/IN houses/NNS
./.

The/DT silverfish/NN is/VBZ an/DT insect/NN which/WDT grows/VBZ

on/IN the/DT glue/NN used/VBN in/IN book/NN bindings/NNS ,/, cardboard/NN
boxes/NNS and/CC the/DT like/JJ ./.

So/RB ,/, the/DT places/NNS you/PRP 're/VBP likely/JJ to/TO have/VB
problems/NNS with/IN silverfish/NNS are/VBP around/IN books/NNS and/CC
bookshelves/NNS ./.

Silverfish/NNS are/VBP capable/JJ of/IN destroying/VBG books/NNS and/CC
other/JJ valuable/JJ papers/NNS so/IN if/IN you/PRP find/VBP them/PRP in/IN
your/PRP$ house/NN ,/, you/PRP 'll/MD need/VB to/TO control/VB them/PRP ./.

Any/DT of/IN the/DT so-called/JJ household/NN insecticides/NNS are/VBP

The/DT earwig/NN is/VBZ a/DT different/JJ problem/NN ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ usually/RB a/DT pest/NN in/IN newer/JJR subdivisions/NNS
where/WRB houses/NNS have/VBP been/VBN built/VBN in/IN what/WP was/VBD a/DT

Actually/RB ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB a/DT case/NN of/IN the/DT earwigs/NNS
moving/VBG in/IN on/IN people/NNS ,/, but/CC people/NNS moving/VBG in/IN

Earwigs/NNS do/VBP n't/RB harm/VB people/NNS ./.

They/PRP do/VBP n't/RB bite/VB ,/, sting/VB ,/, or/CC pinch/VB ./.

But/CC ,/, they/PRP do/VBP look/VB bad/JJ and/CC they/PRP have/VBP an/DT

Of/IN course/NN ,/, they/PRP can/MD be/VB a/DT nuisance/NN when/WRB they/PRP
get/VBP inside/IN the/DT house/NN ./.

They/PRP feed/VBP exclusively/RB on/IN insects/NNS and/CC related/JJ

Your/PRP$ first/JJ line/NN of/IN defense/NN against/IN earwigs/NNS should/MD

Advantages/NNS of/IN Breast-feeding/VBG Your/PRP$ Baby/NN The/DT American/NNP

because/IN of/IN the/DT advantages/NNS breast-feeding/NN offers/VBZ both/CC

Because/IN the/DT nutrients/NNS in/IN breast/NN milk/NN are/VBP easily/RB
digested/VBN and/CC ideally/RB suited/VBN to/TO a/DT baby/NN 's/POS

nutrient/NN a/DT baby/NN needs/VBZ for/IN the/DT first/JJ six/CD months/NNS
of/IN life/NN ./.

Usually/RB ,/, no/DT vitamin/NN or/CC mineral/NN supplements/NNS are/VBP
needed/VBN ,/, but/CC sometimes/RB doctors/NNS may/MD prescribe/VB
vitamin/NN D/NN and/CC iron/NN for/IN some/DT babies/NNS ,/, and/CC they/PRP
may/MD urge/VB mothers/NNS to/TO give/VB their/PRP$ breast-fed/JJ babies/NNS

Besides/IN getting/VBG the/DT nutrients/NNS they/PRP need/VBP ,/,
nursing/VBG babies/NNS also/RB get/VBP other/JJ health/NN benefits/NNS ./.

Nursing/VBG infants/NNS have/VBP fewer/JJR gastronomical/JJ illnesses/NNS

Breast-fed/JJ infants/NNS also/RB have/VBP fewer/JJR allergic/JJ
reactions/NNS than/IN do/VBP babies/NNS fed/VBN with/IN bottles/NNS ./.

Another/DT advantage/NN of/IN breast-feeding/VBG|NN is/VBZ that/IN
nursing/VBG mothers/NNS do/VBP n't/RB have/VB to/TO buy/VB ,/, prepare/VB

Breast-feeding/VBG|NN also/RB helps/VBZ new/JJ mothers/NNS return/VB to/TO
their/PRP$ pre-pregnancy/JJ weights/NNS because/RB/IN of/IN the/DT extra/JJ

Nursing/VBG mothers/NNS also/RB report/VBP that/IN the/DT time/NN spent/VBD
breast-feeding/VBG their/PRP$ babies/NNS is/VBZ a/DT special/JJ time/NN
for/IN mother/NN and/CC baby/NN ./.

This/DT closeness/NN is/VBZ another/DT advantage/NN of/IN breast-feeding/NN

This/DT is/VBZ a/DT safe/JJ ,/, adequate/JJ amount/NN ./.

Only/RB one/CD teaspoon/NN of/IN table/NN salt/NN contains/VBZ about/RB
2,000/CD milligrams/NNS of/IN sodium/NN ./.

About/RB one-fourth/NN of/IN most/JJS of/IN our/PRP$ sodium/NN intake/NN

Sodium/NN occurs/VBZ naturally/RB in/IN foods/NNS ,/, too/RB ,/, but/CC
usually/RB in/IN small/JJ amounts/NNS ./.

If/IN your/PRP$ doctor/NN prescribes/VBZ a/DT low-sodium/JJ diet/NN for/IN
you/PRP ,/, you/PRP 'll/MD be/VB eating/VBG a/DT lot/NN of/IN fresh/JJ

Risks/NNS in/IN Feeding/VBG Infants/NNS Whole/JJ or/CC Skim/JJ Milk/NN
Until/IN just/RB a/DT few/JJ years/NNS ago/RB ,/, human/JJ milk/NN was/VBD
the/DT mainstay/NN of/IN most/JJS infants/NNS '/POS diets/NNS ./.

Recently/RB ,/, many/JJ formulas/NNS which/WDT closely/RB resemble/VBP
human/JJ milk/NN have/VBP been/VBN developed/VBN ./.

Most/RBS physicians/NNS now/RB recommend/VBP breast-feeding/NN for/IN
most/JJS infants/NNS with/IN formulas/NNS the/DT next/JJ best/JJS choice/NN
./.

Some/DT mothers/NNS wonder/VBP about/IN feeding/VBG whole/JJ cow/NN 's/POS
milk/NN to/TO their/PRP$ infants/NNS and/CC how/WRB it/PRP compares/VBZ to/TO
human/JJ milk/NN ./.

Cow/NN 's/POS milk/NN contains/VBZ more/JJR protein/NN than/IN human/JJ
milk/NN ,/, so/IN it/PRP must/MD be/VB diluted/VBN before/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ
fed/VBN to/TO babies/NNS ./.

The/DT pattern/NN of/IN amino/JJ acids/NNS in/IN human/JJ milk/NN is/VBZ
more/RBR appropriate/JJ for/IN infants/NNS than/IN that/DT found/VBN in/IN
cow/NN 's/POS milk/NN ./.

Also/RB ,/, the/DT fat/NN in/IN human/JJ milk/NN is/VBZ better/RBR
absorbed/VBN than/IN the/DT fat/NN in/IN cow/NN 's/POS milk/NN ./.

Human/JJ milk/NN contains/VBZ higher/JJR levels/NNS of/IN vitamins/NNS A/NN
,/, C/NN and/CC E/NN than/IN does/VBZ cow/NN 's/POS milk/NN ./.

The/DT iron/NN in/IN human/JJ milk/NN is/VBZ more/RBR efficiently/RB
absorbed/VBN by/IN babies/NNS than/IN the/DT iron/NN in/IN cow/NN 's/POS
milk/NN and/CC because/IN of/IN this/DT ,/, anemia/NN is/VBZ less/RBR
likely/JJ to/TO be/VB a/DT problem/NN among/IN nursing/VBG infants/NNS ./.

And/CC ,/, as/IN for/IN calcium/NN ,/, human/JJ milk/NN contains/VBZ
less/JJR calcium/NN but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ more/RBR easily/RB absorbed/VBN
than/IN the/DT calcium/NN in/IN cow/NN 's/POS milk/NN ./.

In/IN addition/NN to/TO the/DT nutritional/JJ benefits/NNS ,/, human/JJ
milk/NN provides/VBZ some/DT protection/NN for/IN infants/NNS against/IN
various/JJ intestinal/JJ and/CC respiratory/JJ illnesses/NNS ./.

Also/RB ,/, babies/NNS who/WP are/VBP fed/VBN human/JJ milk/NN are/VBP
less/RBR likely/JJ to/TO develop/VB allergies/NNS than/IN those/DT
babies/NNS on/IN cow/NN 's/POS milk/NN ./.

Many/JJ nutrition/NN experts/NNS recommend/VBP whole/JJ milk/NN after/IN

There/EX 's/VBZ also/RB less/JJR air/NN forced/VBN into/IN the/DT

Because/IN homemade/JJ ice/NN cream/NN is/VBZ frozen/VBN slowly/RB ,/,

If/IN you/PRP have/VBP n't/RB made/VBN the/DT custard/NN early/RB enough/RB

Cool/VB the/DT container/NN and/CC the/DT dasher/NN thoroughly/RB before/IN

Do/VB n't/RB try/VB to/TO freeze/VB a/DT warm/JJ custard/NN --/: the/DT
ice/NN cream/NN will/MD have/VB a/DT buttery/JJ flavor/NN and/CC texture/NN
./.

Use/VB cream/NN that/WDT can/MD be/VB whipped/VBN ./.

Whipping/VBG|NN helps/VBZ make/VB the/DT ice/NN cream/NN smoother/JJR by/IN
incorporating/VBG air/NN into/IN the/DT cream/NN and/CC distributing/VBG
the/DT fat/NN evenly/RB ./.  Fill/VB the/DT freezer/NN only/RB
two-thirds/NNS full/JJ to/TO leave/VB room/NN for/IN the/DT ice/NN cream/NN
to/TO expand/VB as/IN it/PRP freezes/VBZ ./.

After/IN placing/VBG the/DT ice/NN cream/NN container/NN in/IN the/DT
bucket/NN ,/, fill/VB the/DT bucket/NN one-third/NN full/NN of/IN ice/NN
before/IN you/PRP start/VBP to/TO add/VB salt/NN ./.

Alternate/VB salt/NN and/CC ice/NN until/IN the/DT bucket/NN is/VBZ full/JJ
./.

Use/VB one/CD part/NN salt/NN to/TO eight/CD parts/NNS ice/NN ./.

If/IN the/DT ice/NN cream/NN is/VBZ granular/JJ ,/, you/PRP may/MD have/VB
added/VBN too/RB much/JJ salt/NN to/TO the/DT ice/NN or/CC you/PRP may/MD

Poaching/VBG Eggs/NNS If/IN you/PRP are/VBP watching/VBG your/PRP$ weight/NN

One/CD large/JJ egg/NN has/VBZ only/RB 80/CD calories/NNS ./.

Two/CD eggs/NNS are/VBP equivalent/JJ to/TO one/CD serving/NN of/IN meat/NN
./.

To/TO poach/VB an/DT egg/NN all/DT you/PRP need/VBP is/VBZ a/DT deep/JJ

If/IN you/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO use/VB a/DT poaching/NN ring/NN to/TO
help/VB keep/VB the/DT egg/NN in/IN an/DT attractive/JJ shape/NN ,/,
make/VB one/CD by/IN using/VBG tuna/NN cans/NNS or/CC other/JJ small/JJ

The/DT rings/NNS work/VBP best/RBS in/IN more/RBR shallow/JJ pans/NNS

Set/VB the/DT rings/NNS in/IN the/DT simmering/VBG water/NN and/CC slip/VB

Poaching/VBG|NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT easiest/JJS ways/NNS to/TO
cook/VB an/DT egg/NN ./.  Eggs/NNS should/MD be/VB as/RB fresh/JJ as/IN

This/DT helps/VBZ to/TO prevent/VB the/DT egg/NN white/NN from/IN
spreading/VBG --/: producing/VBG a/DT more/RBR compact/JJ poached/JJ egg/NN
./.

To/TO properly/RB poach/VB eggs/NNS ,/, heat/VB two/CD to/TO three/CD
inches/NNS of/IN liquid/NN to/TO boiling/NN ./.

You/PRP may/MD use/VB water/NN ,/, broth/NN ,/, tomato/NN juice/NN ,/,

When/WRB the/DT liquid/NN begins/VBZ to/TO boil/VB ,/, reduce/VB the/DT

Break/VB cold/JJ eggs/NNS ,/, one/CD at/IN a/DT time/NN ,/, into/IN a/DT

Hold/VB the/DT dish/NN close/RB to/TO the/DT liquid/NN 's/POS surface/NN

Cook/VB the/DT eggs/NNS in/IN the/DT simmering/VBG liquid/NN for/IN
about/RB three/CD to/TO five/CD minutes/NNS ./.

After/IN about/RB three/CD minutes/NNS of/IN cooking/VBG|NN ,/, the/DT

still/RB flow/VB ./.

Yolks/NNS will/MD harden/VB after/IN five/CD minutes/NNS of/IN

Once/IN the/DT eggs/NNS are/VBP poached/VBN as/IN desired/VBN ,/, lift/VB
them/PRP out/RP with/IN a/DT slotted/JJ spoon/NN and/CC drain/VB them/PRP
in/IN the/DT spoon/NN or/CC on/IN paper/NN towels/NNS ./.

Eggs/NNS provide/VBP high-quality/JJ protein/NN and/CC are/VBP very/RB
low/JJ in/IN cost/NN ./.  Since/IN a/DT dozen/NN eggs/NNS weighs/VBZ one/CD

only/RB two-thirds/NNS of/IN the/DT price/NN per/IN dozen/NN ./.

With/IN the/DT exception/NN of/IN vitamin/NN C/NN ,/, eggs/NNS are/VBP a/DT

Be/VB careful/JJ not/RB to/TO over-toast/VB pecans/NNS ./.

Smaller/JJR pecans/NNS cook/VBP faster/RBR ,/, so/RB taste/VB them/PRP as/IN

If/IN your/PRP$ oven/NN does/VBZ n't/RB have/VB a/DT defrost/NN power/NN

Rotate/VB the/DT dish/NN at/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN each/DT heating/NN

Separate/VB pieces/NNS for/IN faster/JJR thawing/NN ./.

When/WRB cooking/VBG chicken/NN in/IN the/DT microwave/NN oven/NN ,/,
you/PRP should/MD allow/VB about/RB six/CD to/TO seven/CD minutes/NNS of/IN

However/RB ,/, not/RB all/DT microwave/NN ovens/NNS cook/VBP at/IN

make/VB your/PRP$ microwave/NN cooked/JJ chicken/NN dinners/NNS more/RBR

To/TO brown/VB chicken/NN ,/, coat/VB it/PRP with/IN soy/NN sauce/NN ,/,
paprika/NN ,/, barbeque/NN sauce/NN ,/, brown/JJ bouquet/NN ,/,
Worcestershire/NNP sauce/NN ,/, or/CC special/JJ microwave/NN browning/NN

Chicken/NN usually/RB cooks/VBZ best/RBS when/WRB the/DT oven/NN cooking/NN
level/NN is/VBZ set/VBN on/IN "/" high/JJ ./.

"/" For/IN less/JJR than/IN three/CD pounds/NNS of/IN chicken/NN ,/, you/PRP
may/MD want/VB to/TO use/VB a/DT cooking/NN level/NN of/IN "/" medium/JJ
high/JJ "/" to/TO "/" high/JJ ./.

"/" When/WRB cooking/VBG chicken/NN parts/NNS ,/, put/VB the/DT larger/JJR
,/, meatier/JJR parts/NNS near/IN the/DT outside/NN and/CC tuck/VB the/DT
giblets/NNS under/IN the/DT breast/NN ./.

To/TO keep/VB moisture/NN in/IN the/DT meat/NN and/CC to/TO avoid/VB
spatter/NN ,/, cover/VB the/DT chicken/NN with/IN wax/NN paper/NN ,/, a/DT
glass/NN cover/NN ,/, or/CC plastic/NN wrap/NN with/IN one/CD corner/NN
folded/VBN back/RP for/IN a/DT vent/NN ./.

Remember/VB ,/, standing/NN time/NN is/VBZ important/JJ because/IN

Converting/VBG Recipes/NNS for/IN Microwave/NN After/IN you/PRP have/VBP

You/PRP 'll/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO convert/VB some/DT recipes/NNS very/RB

Because/IN microwave/NN ovens/NNS cook/VBP more/RBR quickly/RB and/CC
with/IN less/JJR evaporation/NN ,/, you/PRP will/MD need/VB to/TO reduce/VB
the/DT moisture/NN in/IN the/DT conventional/JJ recipe/NN by/IN

For/IN example/NN ,/, if/IN your/PRP$ recipe/NN calls/VBZ for/IN one/CD

a/DT cup/NN ./.

For/IN this/DT same/JJ reason/NN you/PRP should/MD use/VB herbs/NNS and/CC

To/TO help/VB you/PRP determine/VB cooking/NN times/NNS ,/, remember/VB
that/IN one/CD cup/NN of/IN tap/NN water/NN boils/VBZ in/IN two/CD and/CC

takes/VBZ one-fourth/PDT the/DT time/NN required/VBN in/IN a/DT
conventional/JJ oven/NN ./.

If/IN your/PRP$ favorite/JJ casserole/NN takes/VBZ one/CD hour/NN in/IN a/DT
conventional/JJ oven/NN ,/, it/PRP should/MD cook/VB in/IN about/RB 15/CD
minutes/NNS in/IN a/DT microwave/NN oven/NN ./.

one-fourth/PDT the/DT conventional/JJ cooking/NN time/NN for/IN items/NNS

The/DT best/JJS way/NN to/TO do/VB this/DT is/VBZ to/TO reduce/VB the/DT

You/PRP may/MD associate/VB calorie/NN cutting/NN with/IN weight/NN

A/DT calorie/NN is/VBZ a/DT measure/NN of/IN energy/NN or/CC the/DT

The/DT food/NN you/PRP eat/VBP is/VBZ your/PRP$ energy/NN intake/NN and/CC
physical/JJ activity/NN is/VBZ your/PRP$ energy/NN output/NN ./.

The/DT calorie/NN is/VBZ defined/VBN as/IN the/DT amount/NN of/IN energy/NN
needed/VBN to/TO raise/VB the/DT temperature/NN of/IN one/CD gram/NN of/IN

Carbohydrates/NNS ,/, fats/NNS and/CC protein/NN --/: three/CD of/IN the/DT

The/DT amount/NN of/IN energy/NN food/NN contains/VBZ is/VBZ measured/VBN
in/IN 1,000-calorie/JJ units/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP called/VBN "/"

"/" Although/IN the/DT calories/NNS you/PRP add/VBP up/RP for/IN a/DT day/NN

the/DT term/NN "/" calorie/NN "/" is/VBZ used/VBN to/TO designate/VB

The/DT number/NN of/IN calories/NNS you/PRP need/VBP depends/VBZ on/IN
the/DT amount/NN of/IN energy/NN your/PRP$ body/NN uses/VBZ ./.

Because/IN people/NNS are/VBP different/JJ ,/, their/PRP$ caloric/JJ
needs/NNS are/VBP different/JJ ,/, too/RB ./.

These/DT calorie/NN differences/NNS are/VBP due/JJ to/TO differences/NNS
in/IN basal/JJ metabolic/JJ rate/NN for/IN basic/JJ body/NN functions/NNS

They/PRP 're/VBP also/RB due/JJ to/TO differences/NNS in/IN levels/NNS of/IN

When/WRB you/PRP normally/RB take/VBP in/RP more/JJR calories/NNS than/IN
your/PRP$ body/NN needs/NNS for/IN all/DT of/IN these/DT activities/NNS

The/DT best/JJS way/NN to/TO lose/VB this/DT body/NN fat/NN is/VBZ to/TO
decrease/VB food/NN consumption/NN and/CC increase/VB physical/JJ

However/RB ,/, you/PRP should/MD never/RB drastically/RB reduce/VB your/PRP$
food/NN intake/NN ./.  Diets/NNS which/WDT contain/VBP too/RB few/JJ

Changing/VBG Food/NN Habits/NNS Losing/VBG weight/NN and/CC keeping/VBG

Cooking/NN Methods/NNS to/TO Cut/VB Calories/NNS When/WRB it/PRP comes/VBZ
to/TO cutting/VBG calories/NNS in/IN cooking/VBG|NN ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT
first/JJ things/NNS you/PRP need/VBP to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO do/VB is/VBZ
recognize/VB high/JJ calorie/NN foods/NNS ./.

Generally/RB ,/, high/JJ calorie/NN foods/NNS have/VBP these/DT
characteristics/NNS --/: thick/JJ ,/, oily/JJ or/CC greasy-crisp/JJ ,/,
slick/JJ ,/, smooth/JJ or/CC gooey/JJ ,/, sweet/JJ or/CC sticky/JJ ,/,
compact/JJ or/CC concentrated/JJ alcohol/NN ./.

Generally/RB ,/, low/JJ calorie/NN foods/NNS have/VBP these/DT
characteristics/NNS --/: thin/JJ ,/, watery/JJ or/CC diluted/JJ ,/,
bulky/JJ or/CC with/IN lots/NNS of/IN fiber/NN or/CC coarseness/NN ,/,
water-crisp/JJ ./.

Now/RB ,/, down/IN to/TO cooking/VBG to/TO cut/VB calories/NNS ./.

First/RB ,/, avoid/VB adding/VBG fat/NN to/TO cooked/JJ vegetables/NNS ./.

Instead/RB ,/, combine/VB different/JJ vegetables/NNS to/TO get/VB
variety/NN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, green/JJ beans/NNS and/CC

Also/RB ,/, cook/VB without/IN added/JJ butter/NN ,/, margarine/NN ,/,

Let/VB each/DT person/NN season/NN his/PRP$ or/CC her/PRP$ own/JJ food/NN ./.

You/PRP can/MD also/RB cut/VB down/RP on/IN calories/NNS by/IN removing/VBG
all/DT visible/JJ fat/NN from/IN meat/NN ./.

Most/JJS fish/NNS are/VBP low/JJ in/IN fat/NN ./.

Fat/NN in/IN poultry/NN is/VBZ usually/RB just/RB under/IN the/DT skin/NN
,/, so/IN removing/VBG the/DT skin/NN will/MD reduce/VB the/DT calories/NNS
./.

Use/VB meat/NN drippings/NNS after/IN the/DT fat/NN has/VBZ been/VBN
skimmed/VBN off/RP ,/, and/CC stay/VB away/RB from/IN "/" country-style/JJ
"/" preparation/NN ./.

Cooking/VBG in/IN gravies/NNS or/CC sauces/NNS adds/VBZ many/JJ
calories/NNS ./.

Remember/VB ,/, alcoholic/JJ beverages/NNS are/VBP high/JJ in/IN
calories/NNS ./.

And/CC there/EX are/VBP loads/NNS of/IN calories/NNS in/IN the/DT
snacks/NNS often/RB eaten/VBN with/IN alcoholic/JJ beverages/NNS ./.

The/DT famous/JJ three/CD martini/NNS lunch/NN contains/VBZ 420/CD

Dry/JJ wines/NNS are/VBP lower/JJR in/IN calories/NNS than/IN sweet/JJ

And/CC finally/RB ,/, use/VB items/NNS containing/VBG sugar/NN

Dangers/NNS of/IN Fad/NN Diets/NNS The/DT latest/JJS weight/NN reducing/VBG

fads/NNS ,/, are/VBP here/RB one/CD day/NN and/CC gone/JJ the/DT next/JJ
./.

These/DT diet/NN fads/NNS appeal/VBP to/TO many/JJ people/NNS because/IN
they/PRP promise/VBP an/DT easy/JJ ,/, quick/JJ way/NN to/TO lose/VB
weight/NN ./.  Some/DT popular/JJ diets/NNS allow/VBP very/RB little/JJ
food/NN or/CC even/RB promote/VBP fasting/VBG|NN for/IN certain/JJ

through/IN the/DT eating/NN of/IN particular/JJ foods/NNS or/CC the/DT
combination/NN of/IN certain/JJ foods/NNS ./.

The/DT problem/NN with/IN most/JJS of/IN these/DT diets/NNS is/VBZ that/IN
they/PRP 're/VBP not/RB balanced/JJ and/CC do/VBP n't/RB provide/VB the/DT
necessary/JJ nutrients/NNS ./.

If/IN you/PRP follow/VBP any/DT of/IN them/PRP for/IN a/DT long/JJ period/NN
of/IN time/NN ,/, they/PRP may/MD be/VB harmful/JJ ./.

In/IN addition/NN ,/, most/JJS of/IN these/DT diets/NNS do/VBP n't/RB
change/VB your/PRP$ dietary/JJ habits/NNS so/IN as/IN to/TO produce/VB
lasting/JJ weight/NN loss/NN ./.

Some/DT weight/NN control/NN fads/NNS include/VBP low/JJ carbohydrate/NN
diets/NNS ./.

These/DT diets/NNS prescribe/VBP foods/NNS rich/JJ in/IN protein/NN and/CC
fat/JJ with/IN very/RB little/JJ carbohydrate/NN ./.

Because/IN little/JJ or/CC no/DT carbohydrate/NN is/VBZ allowed/VBN ,/,
these/DT diets/NNS quickly/RB lose/VBP their/PRP$ appeal/NN ./.

The/DT weight/NN loss/NN ,/, especially/RB the/DT large/JJ amount/NN at/IN
the/DT beginning/NN of/IN these/DT diets/NNS ,/, is/VBZ primarily/RB
water/NN ./.

Low/JJ carbohydrate/NN diets/NNS also/RB lack/VBP essential/JJ vitamins/NNS
and/CC minerals/NNS and/CC could/MD cause/VB elevated/JJ blood/NN
cholesterol/NN levels/NNS and/CC ketosis/NN ./.

Ketosis/NN occurs/VBZ when/WRB carbohydrates/NNS are/VBP not/RB
available/JJ to/TO the/DT body/NN for/IN energy/NN ./.  Substances/NNS
called/VBN ketones/NNS build/VBP up/RP in/IN the/DT blood/NN causing/VBG
it/PRP to/TO become/VB acidic/JJ ./.

Symptoms/NNS of/IN ketones/NNS include/VBP fatigue/NN ,/, weakness/NN ,/,
nausea/NN ,/, dehydration/NN ,/, and/CC bad/JJ breath/NN ./.

Liquid/JJ protein/NN or/CC supplemented/JJ fasting/NN is/VBZ supposed/VBN
to/TO burn/VB fat/NN while/IN sparing/VBG body/NN muscle/NN ./.

Since/IN most/JJS of/IN these/DT diets/NNS provide/VBP only/RB three/CD
hundred/CD to/TO five/CD hundred/CD calories/NNS per/IN day/NN ,/, they/PRP
are/VBP nutritionally/RB incomplete/JJ ./.

Muscle/NN breakdown/NN may/MD occur/VB due/JJ to/TO the/DT very/RB low/JJ
calorie/NN content/NN of/IN the/DT diet/NN ./.

Side/JJ effects/NNS you/PRP may/MD experience/VB from/IN these/DT liquid/JJ
diets/NNS include/VBP nausea/NN ,/, vomiting/NN ,/, diarrhea/NN ,/,
constipation/NN ,/, muscle/NN cramps/NNS ,/, fatigue/NN ,/, and/CC heart/NN
irregularities/NNS ./.

Some/DT deaths/NNS have/VBP been/VBN attributed/VBN to/TO these/DT
diets/NNS ./.

Fasting/NN is/VBZ an/DT extreme/JJ way/NN to/TO try/VB to/TO lose/VB
weight/NN ./.

One/CD of/IN the/DT main/JJ problems/NNS with/IN fasting/NN is/VBZ that/DT
not/RB only/RB is/VBZ fat/NN burned/VBN ,/, but/CC so/RB is/VBZ lean/JJ
body/NN tissue/NN --/: which/WDT is/VBZ muscle/NN ./.

Since/IN no/DT carbohydrate/NN is/VBZ eaten/VBN with/IN this/DT diet/NN ,/,
ketosis/NN occurs/VBZ with/IN its/PRP$ symptoms/NNS ./.

Fasting/NN can/MD cause/VB many/JJ deficiencies/NNS since/IN it/PRP
lacks/VBZ all/DT essential/JJ nutrients/NNS ./.

Because/IN your/PRP$ body/NN has/VBZ mechanisms/NNS to/TO adapt/VB to/TO
fasting/NN or/CC starvation/NN ,/, it/PRP begins/VBZ to/TO conserve/VB
energy/NN ,/, resulting/VBG in/IN the/DT slowing/NN of/IN weight/NN loss/NN
./.

Another/DT weight/NN control/NN fad/NN is/VBZ diet/NN pills/NNS ./.

These/DT include/VBP appetite/NN suppressants/NNS which/WDT curb/VBP
your/PRP$ appetite/NN ./.

The/DT pills/NNS usually/RB only/RB work/VBP a/DT few/JJ weeks/NNS at/IN
the/DT most/JJS and/CC may/MD produce/VB unpleasant/JJ side/JJ effects/NNS
./.  There/EX is/VBZ also/RB a/DT danger/NN of/IN potential/JJ abuse/NN
of/IN these/DT drugs/NNS ./.

To/TO lose/VB weight/NN safely/RB and/CC keep/VB it/PRP off/RP ,/, your/PRP$
best/JJS choice/NN is/VBZ a/DT combination/NN of/IN nutritious/JJ ,/,
well-balanced/JJ meals/NNS and/CC snacks/NNS using/VBG the/DT basic/JJ
food/NN groups/NNS ,/, and/CC a/DT program/NN of/IN regular/JJ exercise/NN
./.

When/WRB you/PRP 're/VBP considering/VBG a/DT plan/NN to/TO lose/VB
weight/NN ,/, make/VB sure/JJ the/DT reducing/NN plan/NN you/PRP 're/VBP
trying/VBG is/VBZ nutritionally/RB sound/JJ ,/, does/VBZ not/RB promise/VB
miraculous/JJ results/NNS with/IN no/DT effort/NN ,/, and/CC is/VBZ one/CD
that/WDT fits/VBZ your/PRP$ lifestyle/NN and/CC pocketbook/NN ./.

Dieting/VBG|NN During/IN the/DT Holiday/NN Season/NN The/DT holiday/NN
season/NN with/IN its/PRP$ rich/JJ food/NN and/CC drink/NN may/MD be/VB a/DT
disaster/NN for/IN you/PRP if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP trying/VBG to/TO lose/VB
weight/NN or/CC keep/VB from/IN gaining/VBG any/DT ./.

The/DT thing/NN to/TO remember/VB at/IN holiday/NN time/NN is/VBZ that/IN
it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT lot/NN easier/JJR to/TO keep/VB pounds/NNS off/RP than/IN
it/PRP is/VBZ to/TO take/VB them/PRP off/RP ./.

One/CD way/NN to/TO handle/VB this/DT problem/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB
ready/JJ for/IN the/DT foods/NNS before/IN you/PRP see/VBP them/PRP ./.

Learn/VB which/WDT party/NN foods/NNS are/VBP high/JJ in/IN calories/NNS
and/CC which/WDT are/VBP low/JJ so/IN you/PRP can/MD choose/VB the/DT
ones/NNS which/WDT will/MD help/VB you/PRP with/IN your/PRP$ weight/NN
program/NN ./.  A/DT calorie/NN counter/NN book/NN can/MD help/VB you/PRP
with/IN this/DT ./.

If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP not/RB familiar/JJ with/IN a/DT certain/JJ food/NN ,/,
you/PRP can/MD usually/RB judge/VB its/PRP$ calorie/NN level/NN by/IN
certain/JJ characteristics/NNS ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, a/DT food/NN is/VBZ usually/RB low/JJ in/IN
calories/NNS if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ thin/JJ and/CC watery/JJ or/CC crisp/JJ
with/IN watery/JJ or/CC bulky-like/JJ greens/NNS ./.

On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, a/DT food/NN is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO be/VB
high/JJ in/IN calories/NNS if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ greasy/JJ or/CC oily/JJ ,/,
smooth/JJ and/CC thick/JJ ,/, or/CC sweet/JJ and/CC gooey/JJ ./.

Alcoholic/JJ beverages/NNS are/VBP often/RB the/DT downfall/NN for/IN
people/NNS watching/VBG their/PRP$ weight/NN ./.

A/DT highball/NN usually/RB contains/VBZ about/RB 150/CD calories/NNS ,/,
and/CC a/DT sweet/JJ after-dinner/JJ drink/NN may/MD contain/VB even/RB
more/JJR ./.  A/DT half-cup/NN of/IN eggnog/NN ,/, about/RB four/CD
ounces/NNS ,/, contains/VBZ about/RB 170/CD calories/NNS ./.

Add/VB a/DT half-jigger/NN of/IN alcohol/NN to/TO the/DT eggnog/NN and/CC
the/DT calorie/NN content/NN jumps/VBZ to/TO 215/CD calories/NNS ./.

Remember/VB ,/, the/DT higher/JJR the/DT alcohol/NN content/NN of/IN a/DT
drink/NN ,/, the/DT higher/JJR the/DT calorie/NN content/NN ./.

A/DT glass/NN of/IN dry/JJ white/JJ wine/NN has/VBZ a/DT lower/JJR
calorie/NN content/NN of/IN 90/CD calories/NNS ./.

Eating/VBG fewer/JJR calories/NNS in/IN regular/JJ meals/NNS during/IN
the/DT holiday/NN season/NN can/MD help/VB leave/VB room/NN for/IN those/DT
extra/JJ calories/NNS you/PRP 're/VBP likely/JJ to/TO pick/VB up/RP
during/IN parties/NNS and/CC family/NN gatherings/NNS ./.

But/CC ,/, remember/VB that/IN the/DT calories/NNS in/IN all/PDT those/DT

,/, too/RB ./.

Exercise/NN and/CC Weight/NN Control/NN A/DT good/JJ weight/NN loss/NN
program/NN should/MD include/VB moderate/JJ exercise/NN on/IN a/DT

Most/JJS nutrition/NN experts/NNS agree/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ wiser/JJR
to/TO increase/VB your/PRP$ activity/NN rather/RB than/IN cutting/VBG
your/PRP$ calories/NNS drastically/RB ./.

Too/RB low/JJ calorie/NN diets/NNS can/MD result/VB in/IN nutritional/JJ
deficiencies/NNS and/CC poor/JJ health/NN ./.

The/DT type/NN of/IN exercise/NN you/PRP choose/VBP should/MD be/VB
something/NN you/PRP like/VBP to/TO do/VB ./.  Your/PRP$ exercise/NN
program/NN should/MD be/VB based/VBN on/IN your/PRP$ age/NN ,/, health/NN
and/CC physical/JJ condition/NN ./.

Be/VB sure/JJ to/TO check/VB with/IN your/PRP$ physician/NN about/IN the/DT

The/DT most/RBS beneficial/JJ exercise/NN for/IN weight/NN loss/NN and/CC

./.

The/DT exercise/NN should/MD be/VB rhythmic/JJ and/CC aerobic/JJ ,/,
such/JJ as/IN walking/VBG|NN ,/, running/VBG|NN or/CC swimming/VBG|NN ./.

For/IN good/JJ results/NNS ,/, you/PRP should/MD exercise/VB at/IN least/JJS
three/CD days/NNS a/DT week/NN for/IN 20/CD to/TO 30/CD minutes/NNS ./.

Brisk/JJ walking/NN for/IN two/CD to/TO three/CD miles/NNS at/IN least/JJS
three/CD times/NNS a/DT week/NN is/VBZ an/DT excellent/JJ choice/NN of/IN
exercise/NN ./.

When/WRB you/PRP exercise/VBP ,/, you/PRP use/VBP energy/NN ./.

A/DT man/NN weighing/VBG 150/CD pounds/NNS uses/VBZ 80/CD calories/NNS
walking/VBG one/CD mile/NN ./.

A/DT woman/NN weighing/VBG 121/CD pounds/NNS uses/VBZ 63/CD calories/NNS

If/IN the/DT man/NN runs/VBZ one/CD mile/NN ,/, he/PRP uses/VBZ 120/CD

Regular/JJ exercise/NN also/RB strengthens/VBZ your/PRP$ heart/NN ,/,

For/IN a/DT winning/JJ weight/NN control/NN combination/NN ,/, remember/VB

Foods/NNS Lower/JJR in/IN Calories/NNS Some/DT foods/NNS or/CC groups/NNS
of/IN foods/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN the/DT potato/NN ,/, "/" starchy/JJ
foods/NNS "/" and/CC "/" white/JJ foods/NNS "/" ,/, have/VBP gotten/VBN
the/DT reputation/NN of/IN being/VBG fattening/JJ ./.

The/DT truth/NN is/VBZ that/IN since/IN all/DT foods/NNS contain/VBP
calories/NNS or/CC food/NN energy/NN ,/, eating/VBG too/RB much/JJ of/IN
any/DT has/VBZ the/DT potential/NN for/IN leading/VBG to/TO excess/JJ

Of/IN course/NN ,/, some/DT foods/NNS do/VBP contain/VB more/JJR
calories/NNS than/IN others/NNS ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, fat/NN provides/VBZ twice/RB as/IN many/JJ

carbohydrate/NN ./.

Foods/NNS that/WDT contain/VBP large/JJ amounts/NNS of/IN sugar/NN plus/CC
fat/NN are/VBP usually/RB higher/JJR in/IN calories/NNS ,/, also/RB ./.
Most/JJS vegetables/NNS and/CC fruits/NNS are/VBP fairly/RB low/JJ in/IN
calories/NNS because/IN many/JJ are/VBP high/JJ in/IN fiber/NN and/CC
water/NN ./.

Since/IN fiber/NN is/VBZ not/RB digested/VBN it/PRP has/VBZ no/DT

It/PRP takes/VBZ greater/JJR amounts/NNS of/IN vegetables/NNS and/CC
fruits/NNS to/TO equal/VB the/DT amount/NN of/IN calories/NNS in/IN
foods/NNS containing/VBG large/JJ amounts/NNS of/IN fat/NN or/CC

Fresh/JJ fruits/NNS or/CC fruits/NNS packed/VBN in/IN natural/JJ juices/NNS
or/CC water/NN are/VBP also/RB lower/JJR in/IN calories/NNS than/IN
fruits/NNS packed/VBN in/IN syrups/NNS ./.

The/DT way/NN foods/NNS are/VBP prepared/VBN determines/VBZ how/WRB many/JJ
calories/NNS they/PRP contain/VBP ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, a/DT plain/RB boiled/JJ or/CC baked/JJ potato/NN
has/VBZ about/RB 100/CD calories/NNS while/IN that/DT same/JJ potato/NN
served/VBN as/RB hashed/JJ browns/NNS would/MD have/VB 235/CD calories/NNS
./.

Dietetic/JJ foods/NNS are/VBP not/RB always/RB low/JJ calorie/NN either/RB
./.

These/DT foods/NNS usually/RB contain/VBP sweeteners/NNS other/JJ than/IN
sucrose/NN --/: table/NN sugar/NN ./.

These/DT sweeteners/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN sorbitol/NN ,/, yield/VBP as/IN
many/JJ calories/NNS when/WRB eaten/VBN as/IN table/NN sugar/NN ./.

For/IN instance/NN ,/, dietetic/JJ ice/NN cream/NN provides/VBZ about/RB
as/RB many/JJ calories/NNS as/IN regular/JJ ice/NN cream/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP also/RB some/DT reduced/JJ calorie/NN salad/NN

fewer/JJR calories/NNS than/IN regular/JJ products/NNS because/IN of/IN

You/PRP can/MD find/VB the/DT number/NN of/IN calories/NNS per/IN serving/NN

Nutritionally/RB sound/JJ diets/NNS for/IN weight/NN control/NN include/VBP

These/DT basic/JJ foods/NNS are/VBP usually/RB limited/VBN on/IN a/DT

because/IN they/PRP provide/VBP not/RB only/JJ calories/NNS ,/, but/CC

The/DT meat/NN group/NN provides/VBZ such/JJ nutrients/NNS as/IN protein/NN

The/DT milk-cheese/JJ group/NN supplies/VBZ protein/NN ,/, calcium/NN ,/,

Your/PRP$ Daily/JJ Calorie/NN Requirement/NN A/DT commonly/RB asked/VBN
question/NN by/IN those/DT interested/VBN in/IN weight/NN control/NN is/VBZ
,/, "/" How/WRB many/JJ calories/NNS do/VBP I/PRP need/VB every/DT day/NN
?/.

"/" The/DT number/NN of/IN calories/NNS or/CC the/DT amount/NN of/IN
food/NN energy/NN you/PRP need/VBP depends/VBZ on/IN many/JJ different/JJ
factors/NNS such/JJ as/IN your/PRP$ age/NN ,/, health/NN ,/, body/NN type/NN
and/CC size/NN and/CC your/PRP$ activity/NN ./.

Some/DT very/RB active/JJ persons/NNS are/VBP able/JJ to/TO eat/VB
larger/JJR amounts/NNS of/IN food/NN and/CC not/RB gain/VB weight/NN
while/IN those/DT who/WP are/VBP less/RBR active/JJ do/VBP gain/VB
weight/NN ./.

People/NNS who/WP have/VBP rounded/JJ ,/, soft/JJ body/NN types/NNS --/:

easily/RB than/IN those/DT who/WP have/VBP slender/JJ ,/, wiry/JJ body/NN
types/NNS --/: called/VBN ectomorphs/NNS ./.

The/DT Food/NNP and/CC Nutrition/NNP Board/NNP of/IN the/DT National/NNP
Research/NNP Council/NNP has/VBZ suggested/VBN an/DT intake/NN of/IN 2,700/CD
calories/NNS a/DT day/NN for/IN men/NNS between/IN the/DT ages/NNS of/IN
23/CD and/CC 50/CD and/CC 2,000/CD calories/NNS a/DT day/NN for/IN
women/NNS between/IN these/DT ages/NNS ./.

These/DT caloric/JJ allowances/NNS are/VBP suggested/JJ averages/NNS for/IN
adults/NNS performing/VBG light/JJ work/NN ./.

Your/PRP$ individual/JJ calorie/NN need/NN may/MD be/VB more/JJR or/CC
less/JJR ./.

One/CD way/NN to/TO find/VB out/RP how/WRB many/JJ calories/NNS are/VBP
needed/VBN to/TO maintain/VB your/PRP$ present/JJ weight/NN is/VBZ to/TO
multiply/VB the/DT amount/NN of/IN energy/NN you/PRP use/VBP times/CC
your/PRP$ weight/NN ./.

If/IN you/PRP are/VBP inactive/JJ ,/, use/VB 14/CD to/TO 16/CD calories/NNS
to/TO multiply/VB ./.

If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP moderately/RB active/JJ ,/, use/VB 16/CD to/TO 18/CD
calories/NNS ./.

If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP very/RB active/JJ ,/, multiply/VB your/PRP$ weight/NN
by/IN 18/CD to/TO 20/CD calories/NNS ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, an/DT inactive/JJ woman/NN weighing/VBG 120/CD
pounds/NNS would/MD multiply/VB 120/CD by/IN 14/CD ,/, which/WDT would/MD
equal/VB 1,680/CD --/: the/DT amount/NN of/IN calories/NNS needed/VBN
each/DT day/NN to/TO maintain/VB her/PRP$ present/JJ weight/NN ./.

If/IN you/PRP want/VBP to/TO lose/VB weight/NN ,/, you/PRP have/VBP to/TO
burn/VB more/JJR calories/NNS than/IN you/PRP take/VBP in/RP ./.

One/CD pound/NN of/IN body/NN fat/NN represents/VBZ 3,500/CD calories/NNS
./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO gain/VB one/CD pound/NN ,/, you/PRP must/MD eat/VB
3,500/CD calories/NNS more/JJR than/IN your/PRP$ body/NN needs/NNS ./.

Therefore/RB ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO lose/VB a/DT pound/NN of/IN body/NN
fat/NN ,/, you/PRP must/MD eat/VB 3,500/CD calories/NNS less/JJR than/IN
your/PRP$ body/NN needs/VBZ ./.

If/IN you/PRP reduce/VBP your/PRP$ caloric/JJ intake/NN 500/CD calories/NNS
a/DT day/NN for/IN a/DT week/NN ,/, the/DT projected/JJ loss/NN in/IN
body/NN fat/NN would/MD be/VB one/CD pound/NN ./.

Remember/VB that/IN you/PRP are/VBP looking/VBG at/IN pounds/NNS of/IN
actual/JJ body/NN fat/NN loss/NN ,/, not/RB just/RB changes/NNS in/IN
body/NN weight/NN ./.

Weight/NN loss/NN may/MD vary/VB for/IN several/JJ reasons/NNS ./.

On/IN some/DT types/NNS of/IN weight/NN control/NN diets/NNS ,/, more/JJR
fluid/NN is/VBZ lost/VBN at/IN first/JJ ,/, resulting/VBG in/IN sharper/JJR
weight/NN drops/NNS initially/RB ./.  As/IN weight/NN loss/NN continues/VBZ
,/, the/DT body/NN requires/VBZ fewer/JJR calories/NNS for/IN its/PRP$
functions/NNS so/IN the/DT rate/NN of/IN weight/NN loss/NN may/MD be/VB
slow/JJ ./.

Daily/JJ changes/NNS in/IN body/NN fluid/NN also/RB affect/VBP your/PRP$
weight/NN ./.

Just/RB because/IN you/PRP weigh/VBP one/CD pound/NN more/RBR in/IN the/DT

mean/VB that/IN you/PRP 've/VBP gained/VBN one/CD pound/NN of/IN body/NN

The/DT best/JJS combination/NN for/IN losing/VBG weight/NN and/CC
