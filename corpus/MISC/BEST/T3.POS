If/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB the/DT time/NN or/CC desire/NN to/TO

Gray/JJ dingies/NNS can/MD also/RB be/VB caused/VBN by/IN not/RB using/VBG

Another/DT cause/NN of/IN the/DT gray/JJ dingies/NNS is/VBZ overloading/VBG

But/CC ,/, when/WRB you/PRP do/VBP this/DT ,/, the/DT clothes/NNS can/MD
not/RB move/VB freely/RB ,/, resulting/VBG in/IN poor/JJ washing/NN and/CC

Non-phosphate/JJ detergents/NNS ,/, particularly/RB the/DT granular/JJ

hottest/JJS water/NN possible/JJ and/CC dissolve/VB the/DT detergent/NN
in/IN the/DT water/NN before/IN adding/VBG the/DT clothes/NNS ./.  If/IN

Not/RB using/VBG hot/JJ enough/RB water/NN is/VBZ a/DT cause/NN of/IN

costs/NNS of/IN construction/NN ./.  If/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB have/VB
enough/JJ homeowners/NNS insurance/NN you/PRP may/MD not/RB be/VB able/JJ
to/TO replace/VB your/PRP$ home/NN if/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ destroyed/VBN by/IN
fire/NN ./.

There/EX are/VBP four/CD basic/JJ types/NNS of/IN homeowners/NNS
insurance/NN :/: HO1/NNP ,/, HO2/NNP ,/, HO3/NNP and/CC HO4/NNP ./.

The/DT HO1/NNP is/VBZ a/DT stripped-down/JJ policy/NN covering/VBG fire/NN
,/, lightning/NN ,/, windstorms/NNS ,/, hail/NN ,/, explosion/NN ,/, rot/NN
,/, civil/JJ commotion/NN ,/, aircraft-vehicle/NN theft/NN ,/, breakage/NN
of/IN glass/NN or/CC safety/NN glazing/NN materials/NNS ,/, smoke/NN ,/,
vandalism/NN and/CC malicious/JJ mischief/NN ./.

As/IN you/PRP move/VBP up/IN to/TO HO2/NNP ,/, you/PRP get/VBP coverage/NN
from/IN falling/VBG objects/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN a/DT tree/NN falling/VBG
on/IN your/PRP$ house/NN ./.

HO3/NNP adds/VBZ such/JJ things/NNS as/IN the/DT weight/NN of/IN ice/NN ,/,
snow/NN or/CC sleet/NN on/IN your/PRP$ roof/NN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN
the/DT collapse/NN of/IN a/DT building/NN ./.

HO3/NNP also/RB covers/VBZ frozen/JJ pipes/NNS that/WDT burst/VBP and/CC
cause/VBP water/NN damage/NN ./.

If/IN you/PRP have/VBP HO4/NNP ,/, all/DT perils/NNS coverage/NN ,/, it/PRP
covers/VBZ everything/NN except/IN moving/VBG land/NN and/CC water/NN ,/,
war/NN ,/, nuclear/JJ hazards/NNS and/CC the/DT like/JJ ./.

If/IN you/PRP are/VBP in/IN an/DT area/NN which/WDT is/VBZ subject/JJ to/TO
high/JJ water/NN ,/, you/PRP should/MD buy/VB a/DT special/JJ flood/NN
insurance/NN policy/NN from/IN the/DT federal/JJ government/NN ./.

An/DT all/DT perils/NNS ,/, or/CC all/DT risk/NN ,/, coverage/NN usually/RB
costs/VBZ about/RB 40/CD percent/NN more/RBR than/IN the/DT stripped/JJ
down/RP contract/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP does/VBZ give/VB far/RB greater/JJR
protection/NN ./.

These/DT policies/NNS also/RB offer/VBP protection/NN if/IN something/NN
of/IN yours/PRP is/VBZ stolen/VBN while/IN you/PRP are/VBP traveling/VBG ./.

Under/IN most/JJS homeowners/NNS policies/NNS ,/, college/NN students/NNS
away/RB from/IN home/NN and/CC their/PRP$ belongings/NNS are/VBP
protected/VBN ./.

Some/DT policies/NNS let/VBP you/PRP cover/VB the/DT replacement/NN cost/NN
of/IN the/DT building/NN and/CC its/PRP$ contents/NNS ./.

Under/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT replacement/NN policy/NN ,/, if/IN you/PRP
insure/VBP for/IN value/NN ,/, the/DT home/NN or/CC its/PRP$ contents/NNS
will/MD be/VB replaced/VBN as/RB close/RB to/TO the/DT original/JJ as/IN
possible/JJ ./.

Replacement/NN insurance/NN costs/VBZ only/RB a/DT little/JJ more/JJR a/DT
year/NN ./.

For/IN full/JJ coverage/NN of/IN partial/JJ damage/NN ,/, you/PRP must/MD
insure/VB for/IN at/IN least/JJS 80/CD percent/NN of/IN the/DT value/NN
of/IN the/DT house/NN ./.  You/PRP wo/MD n't/RB receive/VB dollar/NN for/IN
dollar/NN coverage/NN for/IN even/RB a/DT partial/JJ loss/NN unless/IN
you/PRP are/VBP insured/VBN for/IN at/IN least/JJS 80/CD percent/NN of/IN
the/DT value/NN ./.

Many/JJ people/NNS think/VBP that/IN if/IN they/PRP buy/VBP $/$ 50,000/CD
worth/NN of/IN insurance/NN and/CC have/VBP a/DT $/$ 25,000/CD loss/NN
on/IN a/DT $/$ 75,000/CD house/NN that/IN they/PRP will/MD receive/VB the/DT
full/JJ $/$ 25,000/CD ./.

This/DT is/VBZ n't/RB true/JJ ./.

You/PRP have/VBP about/RB 75/CD percent/NN covered/VBN ,/, and/CC you/PRP
will/MD get/VB only/RB 75/CD percent/NN of/IN the/DT damage/NN minus/CC
a/DT certain/JJ amount/NN for/IN depreciation/NN of/IN contents/NNS ./.

Replacement/NN cost/NN coverage/NN on/IN the/DT house/NN alone/RB does/VBZ
n't/RB cover/VB replacement/NN cost/NN for/IN the/DT contents/NNS ./.

You/PRP can/MD buy/VB replacement/NN cost/NN insurance/NN for/IN the/DT
contents/NNS under/IN a/DT separate/JJ policy/NN ./.

Under/IN standard/JJ policies/NNS ,/, the/DT replacement/NN of/IN an/DT
article/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN its/PRP$ useful/JJ life/NN ./.

This/DT means/VBZ that/IN after/IN a/DT few/JJ years/NNS ,/, the/DT
replacement/NN value/NN may/MD be/VB zero/CD ./.

Most/JJS contents/NNS insurance/NN is/VBZ equal/JJ to/TO 40/CD percent/NN
to/TO 50/CD percent/NN of/IN the/DT building/NN 's/POS insurance/NN
value/NN ./.

So/RB ,/, if/IN you/PRP have/VBP $/$ l00,000/CD worth/NN of/IN insurance/NN
on/IN your/PRP$ home/NN ,/, you/PRP have/VBP about/RB $/$ 50,000/CD worth/NN
of/IN coverage/NN on/IN its/PRP$ contents/NNS ./.

Because/IN extremely/RB valuable/JJ items/NNS may/MD not/RB be/VB
covered/VBN up/IN to/TO the/DT full/JJ amount/NN of/IN their/PRP$ value/NN
in/IN a/DT standard/JJ policy/NN ,/, you/PRP may/MD need/VB to/TO add/VB
a/DT separate/JJ silver/NN and/CC jewelry/NN floater/NN ./.

Liability/NN is/VBZ another/DT consideration/NN ./.  Most/JJS standard/JJ
contracts/NNS offer/VBP $/$ 25,000/CD liability/NN ./.

In/IN today/NN 's/POS economy/NN ,/, that/DT is/VBZ n't/RB much/JJ ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ generally/RB recommended/VBN that/IN at/IN least/JJS $/$
100,000/CD worth/NN of/IN liability/NN be/VB carried/VBN ./.

There/EX 's/VBZ a/DT small/JJ extra/JJ charge/NN ./.  And/CC ,/, for/IN
just/RB a/DT little/JJ bit/NN more/RBR ,/, you/PRP can/MD get/VB $/$
300,000/CD ./.

Renters/NNS and/CC condominium/NN policies/NNS are/VBP available/JJ ,/,
too/RB ./.

Renters/NNS insurance/NN covers/VBZ only/RB the/DT contents/NNS ,/, not/RB
the/DT building/NN ./.

Condominium/NN owners/NNS insurance/NN covers/VBZ everything/NN inside/IN
the/DT four/CD walls/NNS of/IN the/DT apartment/NN ./.

The/DT structure/NN itself/PRP is/VBZ usually/RB covered/VBN under/IN a/DT
master/JJ insurance/NN contract/NN bought/VBN by/IN the/DT condominium/NN
association/NN ./.

Evaluate/VB your/PRP$ homeowners/NNS insurance/NN every/DT three/CD
years/NNS and/CC ,/, if/IN possible/JJ ,/, add/VB an/DT inflation/NN
endorsement/NN rider/NN to/TO your/PRP$ standard/JJ policy/NN ./.

This/DT way/NN ,/, the/DT cost/NN of/IN homeownership/NN is/VBZ added/VBN
to/TO your/PRP$ policy/NN each/DT year/NN when/WRB the/DT premium/NN is/VBZ
due/JJ ,/, and/CC you/PRP can/MD be/VB sure/JJ you/PRP 'll/MD have/VB
enough/JJ coverage/NN if/IN your/PRP$ home/NN is/VBZ damaged/VBN and/CC
must/MD be/VB replaced/VBN ./.  How/WRB to/TO Buy/VB Appliances/NNS Many/JJ
brands/NNS and/CC kinds/NNS of/IN major/JJ and/CC small/JJ appliances/NNS
are/VBP on/IN the/DT market/NN today/RB ./.

Before/IN you/PRP make/VBP a/DT purchase/NN ,/, ask/VB yourself/PRP if/IN
you/PRP really/RB need/VBP the/DT appliance/NN ./.

Some/DT are/VBP bought/VBN because/RB of/IN the/DT novelty/NN they/PRP
provide/VBP as/RB much/RB as/IN for/IN the/DT functions/NNS they/PRP
perform/VBP ./.

Sometimes/RB a/DT new/JJ appliance/NN does/VBZ n't/RB really/RB save/VB
time/NN or/CC energy/NN because/IN the/DT setting/NN up/RP and/CC
cleaning/NN up/RP take/VBP so/RB much/JJ time/NN ./.

Some/DT features/NNS on/IN appliances/NNS save/VBP time/NN and/CC energy/NN
,/, and/CC some/DT add/VBP convenience/NN but/CC use/VBP more/JJR energy/NN
./.

Sometimes/RB extra/JJ features/NNS are/VBP used/VBN seldom/RB once/IN
the/DT novelty/NN wears/VBZ off/RP ,/, so/IN you/PRP might/MD not/RB want/VB
to/TO pay/VB extra/JJ for/IN these/DT features/NNS ./.

Often/RB the/DT basic/JJ appliance/NN unit/NN is/VBZ the/DT same/JJ for/IN
several/JJ brands/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT price/NN increases/VBZ as/IN the/DT
number/NN of/IN added/JJ features/NNS increases/VBZ ./.

This/DT is/VBZ especially/RB true/JJ on/IN major/JJ appliances/NNS ./.

If/IN you/PRP want/VBP to/TO save/VB money/NN ,/, do/VB n't/RB buy/VB
more/JJR features/NNS than/IN you/PRP really/RB need/VBP ./.

Before/IN you/PRP buy/VBP ,/, consider/VB where/WRB the/DT appliance/NN
will/MD be/VB stored/VBN and/CC where/WRB it/PRP will/MD be/VB used/VBN ./.

Sometimes/RB storage/NN creates/VBZ a/DT problem/NN that/WDT outweighs/VBZ
benefits/NNS ./.

Be/VB sure/JJ the/DT place/NN where/WRB you/PRP 'll/MD use/VB it/PRP is/VBZ
wired/VBN adequately/RB and/CC that/IN there/EX 's/VBZ an/DT outlet/NN
available/JJ ./.

Do/VB n't/RB plan/VB to/TO use/VB extension/NN cords/NNS unless/IN it/PRP
's/VBZ absolutely/RB necessary/JJ because/IN they/PRP reduce/VBP
efficiency/NN and/CC may/MD be/VB dangerous/JJ ./.

Once/RB you/PRP 've/VBP decided/VBN you/PRP really/RB need/VBP the/DT
appliance/NN and/CC that/IN you/PRP have/VBP room/NN for/IN it/PRP ,/,
another/DT important/JJ decision/NN is/VBZ cost/NN ./.

Be/VB sure/JJ to/TO consider/VB the/DT original/JJ price/NN tag/NN plus/CC
any/DT installation/NN costs/NNS as/RB well/RB as/IN operating/NN and/CC
maintenance/NN costs/NNS ./.

High/JJ operating/NN costs/NNS may/MD make/VB energy-efficient/JJ
models/NNS worth/JJ the/DT initial/JJ higher/JJR price/NN ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, some/DT new/JJ models/NNS of/IN refrigerators/NNS
and/CC freezers/NNS are/VBP 50/CD percent/NN more/RBR energy/NN
efficient/JJ than/IN models/NNS 10/CD years/NNS old/JJ ./.

Check/VB the/DT yellow/JJ and/CC black/JJ Energy/NNP Guide/NNP Levels/NNP
on/IN most/JJS major/JJ appliances/NNS for/IN energy/NN information/NN ./.

If/IN you/PRP plan/VBP to/TO spread/VB out/RP payments/NNS ,/, check/VB
the/DT cost/NN of/IN credit/NN ./.

If/IN you/PRP can/MD anticipate/VB buying/VBG an/DT appliance/NN ,/, try/VB
to/TO save/VB a/DT little/JJ each/DT month/NN so/IN you/PRP can/MD pay/VB
cash/NN and/CC avoid/VB the/DT cost/NN of/IN installment/NN buying/NN ./.

You/PRP may/MD even/RB get/VB a/DT lower/JJR price/NN if/IN you/PRP pay/VBP
cash/NN ./.

Anticipating/VBG your/PRP$ purchase/NN will/MD also/RB give/VB you/PRP
time/NN to/TO get/VB the/DT information/NN you/PRP need/VBP to/TO buy/VB
wisely/RB ./.

If/IN you/PRP know/VBP you/PRP 'll/MD be/VB buying/VBG a/DT major/JJ
appliance/NN ,/, start/VB reading/VBG advertisements/NNS ,/, consumer/NN
magazines/NNS and/CC buying/NN guides/NNS available/JJ at/IN your/PRP$
local/JJ library/NN ./.

Ask/VB friends/NNS and/CC relatives/NNS about/IN the/DT models/NNS they/PRP
have/VBP and/CC which/WDT features/NNS they/PRP use/VBP or/CC do/VBP n't/RB
use/VB ./.

For/IN large/JJ appliances/NNS ,/, in/IN particular/JJ ,/, service/NN
may/MD be/VB important/JJ ./.

If/IN you/PRP are/VBP gone/VBN during/IN the/DT day/NN ,/, you/PRP 'll/MD
need/VB a/DT reliable/JJ service/NN person/NN who/WP makes/VBZ calls/NNS
after/IN hours/NNS or/CC on/IN weekends/NNS ./.  Some/DT appliances/NNS
have/VBP a/DT warranty/NN or/CC guarantee/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT terms/NNS
vary/VBP ./.  Be/VB sure/JJ to/TO take/VB time/NN to/TO read/VB the/DT
written/JJ guarantee/NN and/CC do/VB n't/RB just/RB take/VB the/DT word/NN
of/IN the/DT salesman/NN ./.

When/WRB you/PRP buy/VBP ,/, fill/VB out/RP and/CC keep/VB warranty/NN
cards/NNS ./.

Look/VB for/IN safety/NN symbols/NNS and/CC seals/NNS of/IN approval/NN ./.

The/DT UL/NNP (/( Underwriters/NNPS Laboratory/NNP )/) is/VBZ probably/RB
the/DT best/RBS known/JJ safety/NN symbol/NN ./.

Another/DT symbol/NN ,/, a/DT blue/JJ star/NN emblem/NN ,/, may/MD be/VB
found/VBN on/IN gas/NN appliances/NNS ./.

It/PRP means/VBZ that/IN the/DT design/NN and/CC construction/NN meet/VBP
safety/NN and/CC performance/NN standards/NNS of/IN the/DT American/NNP
Gas/NNP Association/NNP ./.

Some/DT magazines/NNS and/CC other/JJ groups/NNS have/VBP seals/NNS of/IN
approval/NN ,/, too/RB ,/, but/CC they/PRP vary/VBP in/IN their/PRP$ worth/NN
to/TO the/DT consumer/NN ./.

Do/VB n't/RB assume/VB that/IN a/DT seal/NN assures/VBZ quality/NN ./.

For/IN the/DT most/JJS part/NN ,/, appliances/NNS on/IN the/DT market/NN
do/VBP what/WP they/PRP are/VBP designed/VBN to/TO do/VB ./.

Your/PRP$ choice/NN of/IN brand/NN and/CC price/NN will/MD depend/VB on/IN
personal/JJ preference/NN and/CC individual/JJ need/NN rather/RB than/IN
actual/JJ differences/NNS in/IN function/NN and/CC quality/NN ./.

Ordering/VBG Merchandise/NN by/IN Mail/NN Most/JJS reputable/JJ mail/NN
order/NN firms/NNS are/VBP eager/JJ to/TO give/VB you/PRP good/JJ service/NN
because/IN they/PRP appreciate/VBP your/PRP$ business/NN and/CC want/VB
you/PRP to/TO order/VB from/IN them/PRP again/RB ./.

But/CC ,/, aside/RB from/IN their/PRP$ willingness/NN to/TO satisfy/VB ,/,
mail/NN order/NN firms/NNS who/WP use/VBP the/DT U.S./NNP Postal/NNP
Service/NNP are/VBP regulated/VBN by/IN the/DT U.S./NNP Postal/NNP Code/NNP
./.

One/CD of/IN the/DT regulations/NNS under/IN which/WDT mail/NN order/NN

Here/RB 's/VBZ how/WRB the/DT 30-day/JJ rule/NN affects/VBZ you/PRP ./.

If/IN the/DT seller/NN knows/VBZ he/PRP ca/MD n't/RB fill/VB an/DT order/NN

If/IN he/PRP 's/VBZ unable/JJ to/TO fill/VB the/DT order/NN within/IN 30/CD

a/DT refund/NN ./.  If/IN you/PRP want/VBP a/DT refund/NN ,/, you/PRP must/MD
notify/VB the/DT seller/NN ./.

But/CC ,/, if/IN the/DT seller/NN notifies/VBZ you/PRP that/IN he/PRP ca/MD
n't/RB fill/VB the/DT order/NN within/IN 30/CD days/NNS and/CC you/PRP
do/VBP n't/RB respond/VB ,/, he/PRP then/RB has/VBZ 60/CD days/NNS to/TO
fill/VB the/DT order/NN ./.

If/IN 60/CD days/NNS pass/VBP and/CC the/DT seller/NN still/RB has/VBZ
n't/RB filled/VBN the/DT order/NN ,/, he/PRP must/MD give/VB you/PRP the/DT
choice/NN of/IN getting/VBG a/DT full/JJ refund/NN or/CC waiting/VBG

If/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB respond/VB when/WRB you/PRP 're/VBP given/VBN
this/DT choice/NN ,/, the/DT seller/NN is/VBZ required/VBN to/TO refund/VB

You/PRP can/MD give/VB the/DT seller/NN any/DT number/NN of/IN 30-day/JJ

This/DT rule/NN does/VBZ n't/RB apply/VB to/TO services/NNS like/IN

Planned/VBN Spending/NN Buys/VBZ More/JJR

Planned/VBN spending/NN helps/VBZ you/PRP get/VB more/JJR for/IN your/PRP$

Since/IN most/JJS of/IN us/PRP have/VBP more/JJR needs/NNS than/IN we/PRP

Planned/VBN spending/NN can/MD help/VB you/PRP take/VB advantage/NN of/IN

First/RB ,/, make/VB a/DT list/NN of/IN your/PRP$ income/NN ,/,
including/VBG your/PRP$ paycheck/NN ,/, social/JJ security/NN or/CC

Now/RB look/VB at/IN your/PRP$ spendable/JJ income/NN after/IN taxes/NNS ,/,
your/PRP$ take-home/JJ pay/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT part/NN you/PRP can/MD spend/VB or/CC save/VB ./.

Next/RB ,/, list/VB your/PRP$ fixed/JJ expenses/NNS :/: mortgage/NN ,/,

Then/RB you/PRP 'll/MD know/VB how/WRB much/JJ to/TO set/VB aside/RB each/DT

For/IN example/NN ,/, if/IN you/PRP get/VBP money/NN each/DT month/NN ,/,

you/PRP 'll/MD have/VB to/TO set/VB aside/RB each/DT pay/NN period/NN to/TO

Subtract/VB this/DT amount/NN from/IN the/DT amount/NN of/IN money/NN

Try/VB to/TO divide/VB the/DT money/NN among/IN the/DT items/NNS you/PRP

Try/VB to/TO plan/VB so/IN these/DT expenses/NNS do/VBP n't/RB take/VB

You/PRP and/CC your/PRP$ family/NN probably/RB have/VBP some/DT ideas/NNS

You/PRP may/MD want/VB clothes/NNS ,/, a/DT piece/NN of/IN furniture/NN

List/VB first/RB those/DT things/NNS you/PRP want/VBP most/RBS ./.

Decide/VB how/WRB many/JJ of/IN the/DT items/NNS you/PRP want/VBP enough/RB

The/DT answer/NN is/VBZ the/DT amount/NN you/PRP 'll/MD need/VB to/TO set/VB

Make/VB sure/JJ the/DT amount/NN adds/VBZ up/RP to/TO no/RB more/JJR

Ten/CD percent/NN of/IN your/PRP$ take-home/JJ pay/NN is/VBZ considered/VBN
a/DT comfortable/JJ debt/NN load/NN ./.

Fifteen/CD percent/NN is/VBZ thought/VBN to/TO be/VB manageable/JJ ,/,
but/CC anything/NN approaching/VBG 20/CD percent/NN is/VBZ a/DT sign/NN
you/PRP 're/VBP getting/VBG deep/JJ in/IN debt/NN ./.

Another/DT rule/NN of/IN thumb/NN for/IN deciding/VBG if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP
overextended/VBN is/VBZ to/TO figure/VB your/PRP$ income/NN and/CC ,/,
excepting/VBG rent/NN or/CC mortgage/NN ,/, determine/VB if/IN you/PRP
can/MD pay/VB off/RP your/PRP$ other/JJ borrowing/NN comfortably/RB in/IN
one/CD year/NN ./.

If/IN so/RB ,/, you/PRP are/VBP probably/RB carrying/VBG a/DT safe/JJ
debt/NN load/NN ./.  It/PRP 's/VBZ easy/JJ to/TO know/VB if/IN your/PRP$
debt/NN load/NN is/VBZ too/RB heavy/JJ ./.

Here/RB are/VBP some/DT signs/NNS you/PRP should/MD look/VB for/IN ./.

You/PRP find/VBP it/PRP harder/RBR each/DT month/NN to/TO make/VB ends/NNS
meet/VB ./.

Another/DT sign/NN is/VBZ that/IN you/PRP rely/VBP on/IN overtime/NN pay/NN
or/CC moonlighting/NN to/TO pay/VB your/PRP$ bills/NNS ./.

Another/DT sign/NN of/IN too/RB much/JJ credit/NN is/VBZ when/WRB you/PRP
pay/VBP only/RB the/DT minimum/NN on/IN your/PRP$ charge/NN accounts/NNS
and/CC sometimes/RB juggle/VBP payments/NNS ,/, stalling/VBG one/CD
creditor/NN to/TO pay/VB another/DT ./.

One/CD other/JJ sign/NN is/VBZ when/WRB you/PRP struggle/VBP to/TO save/VB
even/RB small/JJ amounts/NNS and/CC do/VBP n't/RB have/VB enough/JJ
money/NN saved/VBN to/TO get/VB you/PRP through/IN emergencies/NNS such/JJ
as/IN a/DT cut/NN in/IN pay/NN or/CC repairs/NNS on/IN appliances/NNS or/CC
cars/NNS ./.  Credit/NN can/MD be/VB a/DT real/JJ asset/NN or/CC a/DT
detriment/NN ./.

How/WRB you/PRP use/VBP credit/NN determines/VBZ which/WDT it/PRP will/MD
be/VB ./.

The/DT following/JJ credit/NN guidelines/NNS can/MD help/VB you/PRP
manage/VB your/PRP$ money/NN ./.

Always/RB decide/VB how/WRB you/PRP will/MD pay/VB for/IN an/DT item/NN
before/IN you/PRP buy/VBP it/PRP ./.

Do/VB n't/RB use/VB credit/NN if/IN it/PRP means/VBZ you/PRP will/MD
still/RB be/VB paying/VBG for/IN the/DT item/NN long/RB after/IN it/PRP
is/VBZ used/VBN up/RP or/CC gone/VBN ./.

Remember/VB :/: credit/NN costs/VBZ money/NN ./.

Ask/VB yourself/PRP if/IN you/PRP would/MD buy/VB the/DT item/NN if/IN you/PRP
had/VBD to/TO pay/VB cash/NN for/IN it/PRP instead/RB of/IN putting/VBG
it/PRP on/IN credit/NN ./.

Always/RB use/VB comparison/NN shopping/NN and/CC get/VB the/DT best/JJS
buy/NN for/IN your/PRP$ money/NN ./.

Do/VB n't/RB be/VB a/DT soft/JJ touch/NN for/IN sales/NNS people/NNS ./.

Credit/NN is/VBZ easily/RB available/JJ ,/, and/CC businesses/NNS urge/VBP
people/NNS to/TO use/VB credit/NN because/IN people/NNS who/WP use/VBP
credit/NN may/MD spend/VB more/JJR ./.

Buy/VB only/RB if/IN you/PRP have/VBP a/DT real/JJ need/NN for/IN the/DT
item/NN ./.

Try/VB to/TO use/VB credit/NN only/RB for/IN items/NNS that/WP will/MD
increase/VB in/IN value/NN after/IN you/PRP pay/VBP for/IN them/PRP ./.
Credit/NN always/RB costs/VBZ more/RBR than/IN paying/VBG cash/NN ,/,
even/RB in/IN stores/NNS that/WDT offer/VBP no-interest/JJ accounts/NNS ,/,
because/IN prices/NNS may/MD be/VB slightly/RB higher/JJR ./.

Credit/NN is/VBZ more/RBR expensive/JJ now/RB than/IN it/PRP used/VBD to/TO
be/VB ,/, so/RB shop/VB carefully/RB and/CC use/VB credit/NN only/RB
when/WRB necessary/JJ ./.

Even/RB if/IN you/PRP 're/VBP getting/VBG along/RB fine/RB now/RB ,/, do/VB
n't/RB take/VB on/RP additional/JJ debts/NNS without/IN calculating/VBG
your/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO repay/VB them/PRP ./.

If/IN your/PRP$ mortgage/NN or/CC rent/NN payment/NN takes/VBZ more/JJR
than/IN 25/CD percent/NN of/IN your/PRP$ pay/NN ,/, a/DT debt/NN load/NN
of/IN 20/CD percent/NN is/VBZ probably/RB too/RB much/JJ ./.

Shopping/VBG for/IN Credit/NN

When/WRB you/PRP shop/VBP for/IN credit/NN ,/, look/VB for/IN the/DT
least/RBS expensive/JJ plan/NN you/PRP can/MD get/VB ./.

Select/VB one/CD you/PRP can/MD pay/VB off/RP in/IN a/DT reasonable/JJ
length/NN of/IN time/NN without/IN straining/VBG the/DT family/NN budget/NN
too/RB much/RB ./.

To/TO compare/VB costs/NNS for/IN credit/NN ,/, first/RB look/VB at/IN
the/DT A-P-R/NN ./.

This/DT is/VBZ the/DT annual/JJ percentage/NN rate/NN or/CC the/DT cost/NN
,/, in/IN dollars/NNS ,/, of/IN $/$ 100/CD if/IN you/PRP borrow/VBP it/PRP
for/IN one/CD year/NN ./.

Federal/JJ law/NN requires/VBZ that/IN all/DT credit/NN contracts/NNS
include/VBP the/DT term/NN "/" Annual/JJ Percentage/NN Rate/NN "/" in/IN
large/JJ print/NN ./.

This/DT number/NN ,/, a/DT percentage/NN ,/, must/MD be/VB filled/VBN in/RP
on/IN the/DT contract/NN before/IN you/PRP sign/VBP it/PRP ./.

The/DT term/NN A-P-R/NN must/MD be/VB used/VBN in/IN any/DT public/JJ
advertising/NN of/IN credit/NN terms/NNS ./.

It/PRP can/MD be/VB as/RB low/JJ as/IN 12/CD or/CC 14/CD percent/NN of/IN
what/WP you/PRP borrow/VBP or/CC as/RB high/JJ as/IN 36/CD percent/NN or/CC
more/JJR ./.

Another/DT term/NN required/VBN by/IN law/NN to/TO be/VB in/IN large/JJ
print/NN on/IN installment/JJ loan/NN contracts/NNS is/VBZ the/DT "/"
Total/JJ Finance/NN Charge/NN ./.

"/" This/DT is/VBZ the/DT total/JJ amount/NN ,/, in/IN dollars/NNS ,/,
you/PRP can/MD expect/VB to/TO pay/VB over/IN the/DT length/NN of/IN the/DT
credit/NN contract/NN ./.

It/PRP might/MD include/VB the/DT cost/NN of/IN checking/VBG your/PRP$
credit/NN record/NN and/CC credit/NN insurance/NN ./.

Know/VB what/WDT other/JJ items/NNS you/PRP are/VBP expected/VBN to/TO
pay/VB for/IN besides/IN the/DT amount/NN borrowed/VBN and/CC the/DT
interest/NN ./.

Credit/NN life/NN insurance/NN is/VBZ not/RB required/VBN by/IN law/NN ./.

Because/IN the/DT amount/NN of/IN interest/NN you/PRP pay/VBP for/IN a/DT
loan/NN depends/VBZ on/IN the/DT length/NN of/IN time/NN you/PRP use/VBP
that/DT credit/NN ,/, you/PRP 'll/MD save/VB money/NN by/IN paying/VBG
off/RP the/DT loan/NN as/RB soon/RB as/IN you/PRP can/MD ./.

Look/VB for/IN a/DT plan/NN that/WDT lets/VBZ you/PRP pay/VB off/RP the/DT
loan/NN as/RB soon/RB as/IN you/PRP can/MD ,/, but/CC does/VBZ n't/RB
penalize/VB you/PRP for/IN paying/VBG off/RP early/RB ./.

When/WRB you/PRP set/VBP up/RP an/DT installment/NN plan/NN ,/, be/VB
realistic/JJ about/IN the/DT amount/NN you/PRP can/MD pay/VB each/DT
period/NN ./.

Do/VB n't/RB make/VB payments/NNS so/RB large/JJ that/IN you/PRP create/VBP
financial/JJ pressure/NN on/IN the/DT family/NN budget/NN ./.

If/IN you/PRP use/VBP a/DT credit/NN card/NN ,/, the/DT annual/JJ
percentage/NN rate/NN will/MD be/VB applied/VBN to/TO your/PRP$ monthly/JJ
balance/NN for/IN purchases/NNS and/CC cash/NN borrowed/VBN with/IN the/DT
card/NN ./.

Interest/NN will/MD be/VB less/JJR if/IN the/DT monthly/JJ interest/NN
rate/NN is/VBZ charged/VBN on/IN the/DT balance/NN after/IN current/JJ
payments/NNS are/VBP deducted/VBN ./.

Some/DT creditors/NNS charge/VBP interest/NN on/IN your/PRP$ balance/NN
before/IN current/JJ payments/NNS are/VBP made/VBN ,/, and/CC others/NNS
charge/VBP on/IN the/DT average/JJ daily/JJ balance/NN owed/VBN ./.

If/IN your/PRP$ plan/NN charges/VBZ on/IN the/DT average/JJ daily/JJ
balance/NN ,/, you/PRP will/MD pay/VB less/JJR interest/NN if/IN you/PRP
make/VBP payments/NNS as/RB soon/RB as/IN you/PRP can/MD and/CC keep/VB
the/DT daily/JJ balance/NN as/RB low/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.

Teaching/VBG Children/NNS to/TO Use/VB Money/NN

Today/RB everyone/NN spends/VBZ more/JJR money/NN to/TO live/VB and/CC
families/NNS depend/VBP on/IN money/NN more/RBR than/IN ever/RB before/RB
./.

Because/IN family/NN finances/NNS are/VBP becoming/VBG more/RBR and/CC
more/RBR complicated/JJ ,/, even/RB young/JJ children/NNS should/MD
learn/VB something/NN about/IN money/NN management/NN ./.

Regardless/RB of/IN your/PRP$ child/NN 's/POS age/NN ,/, you/PRP are/VBP
the/DT primary/JJ teacher/NN about/IN money/NN matters/NNS ./.

Your/PRP$ attitude/NN will/MD influence/VB the/DT attitudes/NNS of/IN
your/PRP$ children/NNS ./.

Whatever/WDT significance/NN money/NN has/VBZ to/TO you/PRP as/IN a/DT
parent/NN ,/, whether/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ anxiety/NN or/CC pleasure/NN ,/,
your/PRP$ children/NNS will/MD pick/VB up/RP on/IN it/PRP ./.

Conveying/VBG healthy/JJ attitudes/NNS about/IN money/NN requires/VBZ an/DT
example/NN of/IN using/VBG money/NN without/IN heavy/JJ emotional/JJ
attachments/NNS ./.

Unfortunately/RB ,/, money/NN is/VBZ used/VBN in/IN families/NNS as/IN a/DT
symbol/NN of/IN love/NN ,/, power/NN or/CC approval/NN ./.  Teaching/VBG
money/NN management/NN to/TO children/NNS can/MD be/VB fun/NN ./.

The/DT experience/NN can/MD benefit/VB the/DT relationship/NN between/IN
parent/NN and/CC child/NN ,/, too/RB ./.

If/IN you/PRP gear/VBP your/PRP$ money/NN management/NN lessons/NNS to/TO
the/DT child/NN 's/POS needs/NNS ,/, interests/NNS ,/, abilities/NNS and/CC
level/NN of/IN understanding/NN ,/, you/PRP 'll/MD be/VB successful/JJ in/IN
teaching/VBG money/NN concepts/NNS ./.

Children/NNS can/MD learn/VB new/JJ concepts/NNS about/IN money/NN and/CC
spending/VBG|NN if/IN they/PRP 're/VBP taught/VBN by/IN the/DT use/NN of/IN
examples/NNS ,/, reintroduced/VBN on/IN different/JJ occasions/NNS and/CC
in/IN different/JJ situations/NNS ,/, and/CC if/IN they/PRP 're/VBP
allowed/VBN to/TO practice/VB the/DT concepts/NNS ./.  Here/RB are/VBP
some/DT of/IN the/DT most/RBS important/JJ basic/JJ concepts/NNS of/IN
money/NN and/CC its/PRP$ use/NN :/:

We/PRP must/MD learn/VB to/TO spend/VB before/IN we/PRP can/MD learn/VB to/TO
save/VB ./.

Let/VB your/PRP$ child/NN pay/VB for/IN items/NNS in/IN the/DT store/NN ./.

Savings/NNS is/VBZ just/RB deferred/VBN spending/NN ./.

We/PRP usually/RB save/VBP for/IN a/DT specific/JJ purpose/NN or/CC item/NN
./.

Let/VB your/PRP$ child/NN learn/VB to/TO save/VB for/IN something/NN he/PRP
or/CC she/PRP really/RB wants/VBZ ,/, something/NN that/WDT does/VBZ n't/RB
require/VB too/RB long/JJ a/DT savings/NNS time/NN ./.

Money/NN resources/NNS are/VBP nearly/RB always/RB limited/JJ ./.

Teach/VB your/PRP$ child/NN how/WRB to/TO choose/VB with/IN his\/her/PRP$
limited/JJ funds/NNS from/IN among/IN all/PDT the/DT many/JJ things/NNS
he/PRP or/CC she/PRP wants/VBZ ./.

Most/JJS family/NN economists/NNS and/CC child/NN development/NN
experts/NNS believe/VBP that/IN allowances/NNS geared/VBN to/TO the/DT
age/NN and/CC needs/NNS of/IN a/DT child/NN can/MD help/VB him/PRP or/CC
her/PRP learn/VB to/TO make/VB decisions/NNS and/CC how/WRB to/TO manage/VB
money/NN at/IN an/DT early/JJ age/NN ./.

The/DT allowance/NN should/MD cover/VB fixed/JJ expenses/NNS such/JJ as/IN
school/NN lunches/NNS and/CC varible/JJ expenses/NNS such/JJ as/IN toys/NNS
or/CC extra/JJ food/NN items/NNS ./.  Women/NNS and/CC Credit/NN

Almost/RB every/DT American/NNP has/VBZ at/IN least/JJS one/CD credit/NN
card/NN ./.

Women/NNS can/MD now/RB get/VB credit/NN in/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ names/NNS
simply/RB by/IN deciding/VBG on/IN a/DT purchase/NN and/CC asking/VBG
for/IN credit/NN ./.

The/DT law/NN says/VBZ that/IN creditors/NNS may/MD not/RB discriminate/VB
against/IN anyone/NN because/RB of/IN sex/NN or/CC marital/JJ status/NN ./.

This/DT means/VBZ that/IN you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB be/VB denied/VBN a/DT
loan/NN because/IN you/PRP are/VBP a/DT woman/NN ,/, single/JJ or/CC
married/JJ ./.

One/CD helpful/JJ step/NN in/IN establishing/VBG credit/NN is/VBZ to/TO
open/VB a/DT savings/NNS or/CC checking/NN account/NN in/IN your/PRP$ own/JJ
name/NN ./.

This/DT wo/MD n't/RB give/VB you/PRP credit/NN ,/, but/CC creditors/NNS
often/RB check/VBP accounts/NNS to/TO see/VB if/IN you/PRP have/VBP money/NN
and/CC know/VBP how/WRB to/TO manage/VB it/PRP ./.  Since/IN passage/NN
of/IN the/DT Equal/NNP Credit/NNP Opportunity/NNP Act/NNP ,/, a/DT woman/NN
who/WP qualifies/VBZ for/IN credit/NN now/RB has/VBZ the/DT legal/JJ
right/NN to/TO put/VB the/DT account/NN in/IN her/PRP$ name/NN ./.

Married/JJ women/NNS may/MD use/VB their/PRP$ maiden/NN|JJ names/NNS if/IN
they/PRP wish/VBP ./.

All/DT new/JJ credit/NN accounts/NNS used/VBN jointly/RB by/IN husbands/NNS
and/CC wives/NNS must/MD be/VB filed/VBN by/IN creditors/NNS and/CC
credit/NN bureaus/NN in/IN the/DT names/NNS of/IN both/DT spouses/NNS ./.

A/DT married/JJ woman/NN with/IN her/PRP$ own/JJ income/NN may/MD want/VB
to/TO apply/VB for/IN separate/JJ accounts/NNS for/IN which/WDT she/PRP
alone/RB will/MD be/VB responsible/JJ ./.

This/DT will/MD show/VB creditors/NNS that/IN she/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN
granted/VBN credit/NN only/RB on/IN her/PRP$ own/JJ record/NN of/IN
income/NN and/CC prompt/JJ payments/NNS ./.

Even/RB if/IN you/PRP are/VBP married/JJ ,/, you/PRP need/VBP to/TO make/VB
sure/JJ that/IN your/PRP$ local/JJ credit/NN bureau/NN has/VBZ credit/NN
history/NN information/NN in/IN a/DT separate/JJ file/NN under/IN your/PRP$

an/DT individual/JJ account/NN based/VBN only/RB on/IN your/PRP$ credit/NN
history/NN ./.

When/WRB using/VBG credit/NN ,/, resist/VB the/DT temptation/NN to/TO
overbuy/VB ./.

Do/VB n't/RB get/VB in/IN debt/NN beyond/IN your/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO

Remember/VB how/WRB much/JJ money/NN you/PRP have/VBP and/CC how/WRB much/JJ

Use/VB your/PRP$ credit/NN wisely/RB ./.

Pay/VB your/PRP$ credit/NN accounts/NNS when/WRB they/PRP are/VBP due/JJ ,/,
if/IN at/IN all/DT possible/JJ ./.

This/DT builds/VBZ your/PRP$ credit/NN reputation/NN ./.

If/IN unexpected/JJ expenses/NNS or/CC illness/NN delays/VBZ your/PRP$

In/IN most/JJS cases/NNS ,/, he/PRP will/MD extend/VB payment/NN dates/NNS

Supermarket/NN Scanners/NNS

Another/DT marvel/NN of/IN computer/NN technology/NN has/VBZ found/VBN
its/PRP$ way/NN into/IN our/PRP$ lives/NNS through/IN supermarkets/NNS ./.

It/PRP 's/VBZ the/DT Universal/JJ Product/NN Code/NN (/( or/CC UPC/NNP )/)
scanning/NN system/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ designed/VBN to/TO make/VB
shopping/NN quicker/JJR ,/, easier/JJR and/CC more/RBR pleasant/JJ ./.
Since/IN the/DT scanning/NN system/NN was/VBD introduced/VBN in/IN 1974/CD
,/, it/PRP has/VBZ grown/VBN rapidly/RB and/CC is/VBZ now/RB in/IN use/NN
in/IN about/RB one-fourth/NN of/IN the/DT supermarkets/NNS ./.

The/DT UPC/NNP consists/VBZ of/IN an/DT in-store/JJ computer/NN linked/VBN
to/TO a/DT laser/NN scanner/NN and/CC an/DT electronic/JJ cash/NN

The/DT key/NN to/TO scanning/NN is/VBZ the/DT universal/JJ products/NNS
code/NN (/( UPC/NNP )/) ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT bar/NN code/NN found/VBN
on/IN most/JJS items/NNS --/: in/IN fact/NN ,/, everything/NN from/IN
magazines/NNS to/TO food/NN ./.

The/DT code/NN on/IN each/DT item/NN is/VBZ passed/VBN over/IN a/DT
glass-covered/JJ slot/NN in/IN the/DT checkout/NN counter/NN where/WRB a/DT
laser/NN scanner/NN reads/VBZ the/DT code/NN and/CC transmits/VBZ the/DT

The/DT price/NN previously/RB entered/VBN into/IN the/DT computer/NN for/IN
that/DT item/NN then/RB flashes/VBZ on/IN the/DT visual/JJ display/NN
unit/NN of/IN the/DT cash/NN register/NN and/CC is/VBZ ,/, at/IN the/DT

The/DT first/JJ five/CD numbers/NNS of/IN the/DT code/NN designate/VBP
the/DT manufacturer/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT next/JJ five/CD numbers/NNS
tell/VBP what/WP the/DT specific/JJ product/NN is/VBZ ./.

The/DT retailer/NN may/MD also/RB make/VB UPC/NNP labels/NNS for/IN
products/NNS not/RB coded/VBN by/IN the/DT manufacturer/NN ./.

You/PRP benefit/VBP from/IN the/DT scanners/NNS because/IN you/PRP get/VBP
speedier/JJR checkouts/NNS and/CC more/RBR detailed/JJ receipts/NNS
which/WDT state/VBP not/RB only/RB the/DT price/NN of/IN each/DT item/NN
bought/VBN but/CC also/RB the/DT brand/NN name/NN and/CC size/NN ./.

You/PRP can/MD use/VB these/DT receipts/NNS to/TO make/VB long-term/JJ or/CC
short-term/JJ price/NN comparisons/NNS ./.  The/DT receipts/NNS also/RB
enable/VB you/PRP to/TO compare/VB prices/NNS at/IN different/JJ stores/NNS
and/CC prices/NNS of/IN different/JJ sizes/NNS and/CC brands/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ important/JJ ,/, because/IN about/RB one-fourth/NN of/IN
the/DT money/NN spent/VBN at/IN grocery/NN stores/NNS is/VBZ spent/VBN
on/IN items/NNS that/WDT are/VBP n't/RB even/RB food/NN ./.

These/DT scanner/NN receipts/NNS can/MD help/VB you/PRP see/VB exactly/RB
how/WRB much/RB you/PRP spend/VBP on/IN unnecessary/JJ items/NNS as/RB
well/RB as/IN what/WP you/PRP spend/VBP on/IN products/NNS for/IN

Receipts/NNS can/MD also/RB help/VB you/PRP determine/VB if/IN a/DT

You/PRP can/MD compare/VB the/DT information/NN on/IN your/PRP$ tape/NN

and/CC food/NN expenditure/NN calculations/NNS for/IN families/NNS
similar/JJ in/IN size/NN and/CC age/NN to/TO yours/PRP ./.  These/DT
scanners/NNS also/RB lessen/VBP the/DT likelihood/NN of/IN human/NN
error/NN and/CC may/MD result/VB in/IN lower/JJR prices/NNS when/WRB
retailers/NNS pass/VBP cost/NN savings/NNS on/IN to/TO consumers/NNS ./.

The/DT retailer/NN benefits/NNS by/IN increased/JJ labor/NN productivity/NN

More/JJR and/CC more/JJR supermarkets/NNS will/MD add/VB scanners/NNS ,/,
so/RB it/PRP 's/VBZ important/JJ that/IN you/PRP to/TO learn/VB to/TO use/VB
the/DT information/NN you/PRP receive/VBP on/IN the/DT tapes/NNS from/IN
these/DT scanners/NNS ./.

Controlling/VBG Your/PRP$ Finances/NNS While/IN Unemployed/JJ

The/DT first/JJ crisis/NN of/IN unemployment/NN is/VBZ a/DT financial/JJ

If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP not/RB able/JJ to/TO pay/VB your/PRP$ bills/NNS ,/,

Most/JJS are/VBP willing/JJ to/TO extend/VB payments/NNS or/CC help/VB

It/PRP 's/VBZ often/RB harder/JJR to/TO cope/VB with/IN the/DT stress/NN

Many/JJ homeowners/NNS discover/VBP too/RB late/RB that/IN ordinary/JJ

If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP in/IN a/DT flood/NN prone/JJ area/NN ,/, you/PRP

Insurance/NN rates/NNS are/VBP based/VBN on/IN the/DT likelihood/NN of/IN

Conserving/VBG Water/NN In/IN The/DT Home/NN

Simply/RB check/VB for/IN leaks/NNS ,/, install/VB water-saving/JJ

You/PRP may/MD not/RB realize/VB it/PRP ,/, but/CC leakage/NN accounts/VBZ
for/IN about/RB five/CD to/TO ten/CD percent/NN of/IN all/DT residential/JJ
water/NN consumption/NN ,/, and/CC is/VBZ caused/VBN mainly/RB by/IN
worn-out/JJ faucet/NN washers/NNS and/CC faulty/JJ toilet/NN tank/NN

A/DT steady/JJ drip/NN of/IN a/DT leaking/VBG faucet/NN can/MD waste/VB
as/RB much/RB as/IN 20/CD gallons/NNS per/IN day/NN ./.

A/DT more/RBR serious/JJ type/NN of/IN leak/NN can/MD occur/VB in/IN
toilet/NN tanks/NNS ,/, wasting/VBG as/RB much/RB as/IN 200/CD gallons/NNS
of/IN water/NN a/DT day/NN ./.

Since/IN the/DT leaking/VBG water/NN runs/VBZ from/IN the/DT tank/NN

it/PRP ./.

You/PRP can/MD check/VB for/IN a/DT toilet/NN leak/NN by/IN removing/VBG
the/DT tank/NN cover/NN and/CC placing/VBG a/DT few/JJ drops/NNS of/IN
food/NN coloring/NN in/IN the/DT tank/NN ,/, preferably/RB when/WRB the/DT

If/IN the/DT food/NN coloring/NN seeps/VBZ into/IN the/DT bowl/NN ,/,
your/PRP$ toilet/NN has/VBZ a/DT leak/NN ./.  Correcting/VBG these/DT
leaks/NNS is/VBZ an/DT easy/JJ and/CC inexpensive/JJ way/NN to/TO reduce/VB
water/NN consumption/NN ./.

The/DT next/JJ step/NN you/PRP can/MD take/VB is/VBZ to/TO buy/VB
water-saving/JJ devices/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP usually/RB inexpensive/JJ
and/CC easy/JJ to/TO install/VB ./.

Almost/RB half/CD of/IN the/DT water/NN used/VBN in/IN your/PRP$ home/NN
is/VBZ used/VBN for/IN waste/NN disposal/NN through/IN the/DT toilet/NN ./.

Devices/NNS are/VBP available/JJ to/TO reduce/VB the/DT amount/NN of/IN
water/NN used/VBN to/TO flush/VB the/DT toilet/NN ./.

You/PRP can/MD buy/VB toilet/NN tank/NN volume/NN reducers/NNS ,/,

adjustments/NNS and/CC signal/VBP you/PRP when/WRB there/EX is/VBZ a/DT
leak/NN ,/, or/CC dual/JJ flush/NN mechanisms/NNS which/WDT allow/VBP
you/PRP to/TO select/VB a/DT small/JJ or/CC large/JJ flush/NN ./.

These/DT water-saving/JJ devices/NNS do/VBP not/RB work/VB equally/RB
well/RB in/IN all/DT types/NNS of/IN toilets/NNS ./.

Some/DT are/VBP more/RBR effective/JJ than/IN others/NNS ./.

Do/VB not/RB use/VB a/DT device/NN that/WDT requires/VBZ you/PRP to/TO
flush/VB twice/RB ./.

It/PRP could/MD actually/RB increase/VB your/PRP$ water/NN consumption/NN ./.

You/PRP may/MD have/VB heard/VBN that/IN placing/VBG bricks/NNS in/IN
your/PRP$ toilet/NN tank/NN will/MD reduce/VB the/DT amount/NN of/IN
water/NN in/IN the/DT tank/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, bricks/NNS are/VBP not/RB recommended/VBN because/IN they/PRP
can/MD deteriorate/VB in/IN the/DT water/NN and/CC bricks/NNS can/MD
break/VB parts/NNS of/IN the/DT toilet/NN if/IN you/PRP drop/VBP them/PRP ./.

An/DT alternative/NN to/TO bricks/NNS is/VBZ plastic/JJ bottles/NNS ./.

You/PRP can/MD put/VB one/CD or/CC more/JJR clean/JJ plastic/JJ one-quart/JJ
bottles/NNS filled/VBN with/IN water/NN and/CC a/DT small/JJ stone/NN or/CC
sand/NN in/IN your/PRP$ tank/NN ./.

By/IN using/VBG bottles/NNS ,/, you/PRP can/MD avoid/VB bending/VBG the/DT
float/NN arm/NN down/IN which/WDT lowers/VBZ the/DT water/NN level/NN ./.

Lowering/VBG the/DT water/NN level/NN reduces/VBZ the/DT force/NN of/IN
the/DT flush/NN ,/, resulting/VBG in/IN unsatisfactory/JJ cleansing/NN
of/IN the/DT bowl/NN ./.

If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP installing/VBG a/DT new/JJ toilet/NN ,/, buy/VB one/CD
that/WDT uses/VBZ less/JJR water/NN than/IN the/DT five/CD to/TO seven/CD
gallons/NNS a/DT conventional/JJ toilet/NN uses/NNS ./.

You/PRP can/MD buy/VB an/DT aerator/NN to/TO reduce/VB the/DT flow/NN of/IN
water/NN through/IN your/PRP$ faucet/NN ./.

A/DT thermostat/NN mixing/NN valve/NN or/CC a/DT shutoff/NN valve/NN
near/IN the/DT shower/NN head/NN allows/VBZ you/PRP to/TO turn/VB off/RP
the/DT water/NN while/IN lathering/VBG without/IN disturbing/VBG the/DT
temperature/NN adjustment/NN of/IN the/DT shower/NN controls/NNS ./.

With/IN a/DT shower/NN head/NN flow/NN restriction/NN or/CC controller/NN
,/, you/PRP can/MD reduce/VB by/IN half/PDT the/DT amount/NN of/IN water/NN
used/VBN per/IN minute/NN ./.

A/DT restriction/NN reduces/VBZ the/DT flow/NN of/IN water/NN by/IN
creating/VBG smaller/JJR openings/NNS in/IN the/DT shower/NN head/NN ./.

Constant/JJ rate/NN devices/NNS maintain/VBP a/DT steady/JJ flow/NN rate/NN
regardless/RB of/IN changes/NNS in/IN the/DT water/NN pressure/NN ./.

Water/NN can/MD also/RB be/VB conserved/VBN by/IN using/VBG dishwashers/NNS
only/RB when/WRB they/PRP 're/VBP full/JJ and/CC by/IN buying/VBG
clothes/NNS washers/NNS with/IN variable/JJ water/NN level/NN settings/NNS
./.

By/IN changing/VBG a/DT few/JJ habits/NNS ,/, you/PRP can/MD conserve/VB
even/RB more/RBR|JJR ./.

For/IN example/NN ,/, turn/VB off/RP the/DT water/NN while/IN you/PRP
're/VBP brushing/VBG your/PRP$ teeth/NNS or/CC shaving/VBG ,/, take/VB a/DT

Water/NN Filters/NNS

Americans/NNPS are/VBP becoming/VBG increasingly/RB concerned/VBN with/IN
the/DT quality/NN of/IN water/NN ./.  Many/JJ people/NNS have/VBP
turned/VBN to/TO activated-carbon/JJ water/NN filters/NNS and/CC

Activated-carbon/JJ filters/NNS can/MD effectively/RB remove/VB many/JJ

They/PRP can/MD also/RB help/VB clear/JJ sediments/NNS from/IN tap/NN

which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT suspected/JJ carcinogen/NN ./.

The/DT under-sink/JJ filters/NNS are/VBP the/DT larger/JJR and/CC

./.

They/PRP do/VBP a/DT good/JJ job/NN of/IN removing/VBG chlorine/NN ,/, a/DT

The/DT units/NNS which/WDT use/VBP granular/JJ carbon/NN ,/, as/IN

The/DT powdered/JJ carbon/NN types/NNS have/VBP been/VBN known/VBN to/TO

Units/NNS with/IN hard/JJ plastic/JJ sides/NNS force/VBP water/NN to/TO

The/DT longer/JJR the/DT contact/NN with/IN the/DT filter/NN ,/, the/DT

Some/DT units/NNS also/RB slow/VBP down/RP the/DT water/NN flow/NN rate/NN

These/DT come/VBP with/IN a/DT separate/JJ faucet/NN and/CC tubing/NN to/TO

Faucet/NN or/CC sink-mounted/JJ filters/NNS are/VBP generally/RB

But/CC they/PRP generally/RB have/VBP a/DT lower/JJR useful/JJ flow/NN

their/PRP$ filter/NN lifetime/NN is/VBZ shorter/JJR ./.

You/PRP can/MD use/VB pour-through/JJ portable/JJ filters/NNS when/WRB

Both/CC the/DT electric/JJ models/NNS and/CC those/DT which/WDT work/VBP
like/IN a/DT drip/NN coffee/NN maker/NN can/MD be/VB as/RB effective/JJ
as/IN faucet/NN mounted/JJ filters/NNS ./.

If/IN you/PRP 're/VBP only/RB concerned/VBN with/IN suspended/JJ sediment/NN
in/IN your/PRP$ water/NN ,/, you/PRP need/VBP a/DT fiber/NN filter/NN ,/,
rather/RB than/IN a/DT carbon/NN filter/NN which/WDT clogs/VBZ quickly/RB

Most/JJS manufacturers/NNS of/IN home-use/JJ filters/NNS claim/VBP only/RB
that/IN their/PRP$ products/NNS improve/VBP the/DT taste/NN and/CC odor/NN

A/DT few/JJ claim/NN their/PRP$ products/NNS will/MD remove/VB toxic/JJ

But/CC one/CD thing/NN a/DT water/NN filter/NN will/MD not/RB remove/VB
is/VBZ bacteria/NNS ./.

That/DT 's/VBZ a/DT job/NN for/IN a/DT water/NN purifier/NN ./.

In/IN fact/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ some/DT concern/NN that/IN wet/JJ

In/IN addition/NN ,/, activated/JJ carbon/NN filters/NNS wo/MD n't/RB

The/DT filters/NNS will/MD remove/VB rust/NN particles/NNS ,/, but/CC

For/IN these/DT ,/, a/DT reverse/JJ osmosis/NN unit/NN or/CC ion/NN

You/PRP should/MD change/VB filters/NNS regularly/RB ./.

A/DT heavily/RB used/VBN filter/NN is/VBZ more/RBR likely/JJ to/TO

An/DT exhausted/JJ filter/NN is/VBZ useless/JJ ./.  Do/VB n't/RB filter/VB

A/DT filter/NN on/IN the/DT faucet/NN that/WDT passes/VBZ hot/JJ water/NN

The/DT longer/RBR the/DT water/NN is/VBZ in/IN contact/NN with/IN the/DT

After/IN you/PRP install/VBP a/DT new/JJ cartridge/NN ,/, remember/VB to/TO

Water/NN Hardness/NN

If/IN you/PRP have/VBP problems/NNS with/IN water/NN hardness/NN when/WRB

Water/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN softened/VBN by/IN the/DT cation/NN

Most/JJS softeners/NNS of/IN this/DT type/NN can/MD re-dissolve/VB soap/NN
curd/NN and/CC grease/NN balls/NNS that/WDT have/VBP previously/RB

In/IN order/NN to/TO use/VB packaged/JJ softeners/NNS effectively/RB ,/,
the/DT hardness/NN and/CC quantity/NN of/IN water/NN used/VBN should/MD
be/VB known/VBN so/IN that/IN the/DT proper/JJ amount/NN of/IN softener/NN

You/PRP should/MD follow/VB the/DT package/NN directions/NNS to/TO find/VB

Since/IN packaged/JJ softeners/NNS can/MD not/RB soften/VB water/NN
before/IN it/PRP comes/VBZ from/IN the/DT tap/NN ,/, the/DT softener/NN

When/WRB you/PRP 're/VBP laundering/VBG washable/JJ woolens/NNS and/CC

Since/IN cold/JJ water/NN does/VBZ not/RB clean/VB clothes/NNS as/RB

If/IN you/PRP mix/VBP colors/NNS ,/, the/DT dyes/NNS may/MD transfer/VB

Save/VB energy/NN by/IN keeping/VBG the/DT lint/NN filter/NN clean/JJ on/IN

Also/RB ,/, avoid/VB over/RB drying/VBG clothes/NNS ./.

This/DT wastes/VBZ energy/NN and/CC may/MD cause/VB items/NNS to/TO

To/TO create/VB this/DT transformation/NN ,/, you/PRP need/VBP only/RB a/DT

First/RB ,/, determine/VB whether/IN the/DT plant/NN is/VBZ worthy/JJ of/IN
such/JJ treatment/NN .../: that/DT is/VBZ .../: be/VB sure/JJ you/PRP
like/VBP it/PRP where/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ ./.

A/DT large/JJ shrub/NN near/IN a/DT patio/NN would/MD be/VB more/RBR

A/DT big/JJ shrub/NN may/MD be/VB completely/RB shading/VBG an/DT

Never/RB shear/VB the/DT plant/NN across/IN the/DT top/NN .../: always/RB
remove/VB branches/NNS and/CC trunks/NNS from/IN within/IN the/DT plant/NN
so/IN that/IN you/PRP open/VBP it/PRP up/RP without/IN destroying/VBG the/DT
